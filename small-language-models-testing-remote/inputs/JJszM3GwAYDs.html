<meta property="og:title" content="The Nameless Crowds: Using Quantitative Data and Digital Tools to Study the Ancient Vocabulary of the Crowd in Tacitus" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Combining quantitative and qualitative information, this paper investigates from a lexicological and socio-historical perspective the vocabulary of the crowd in Tacitus, a Roman historian of the 1st-2nd century AD. Unlike most Latin authors, Tacitus uses predominantly the word vulgus in comparison to turba, multitudo and the other nouns referring to urban and military crowds. The singularity of the Tacitean vulgus is not only quantitative, but also qualitative, especially when it comes to its semantic nuances and combinatorial profile. Focusing one after the other in a contrastive way on the phenomenological, sociological and ethological dimensions of the crowds depicted by Tacitus, we show that, while turba and multitudo refer to strongly spatialized crowds, whose social composition does not seem to be a strong defining factor, usually without any own opinion or political autonomy, vulgus refers in Tacitus to a “popular” crowd, defined by its ability to vocalize its own feelings and opinion and to engage in dialogue, or even conflict, with the ruling elites. The vulgus thus seems to become, in Tacitus’ narrative, a new political actor of the imperial regime. Contrary to the institutional populus, the vulgus as political actor does not express its opinion through the ordinary political institutions that were traditionally controlled by the Roman aristocracy (the comitia for instance), but proceeds to do so through vocalizations in non-institutional (albeit deeply political) contexts." />

        <p>Combining quantitative and qualitative information, this paper investigates from a lexicological and socio-historical perspective the vocabulary of the crowd in Tacitus, a Roman historian of the 1st-2nd century AD. Unlike most Latin authors, Tacitus uses predominantly the word <em>vulgus</em> in comparison to <em>turba</em>, <em>multitudo</em> and the other nouns referring to urban and military crowds. The singularity of the Tacitean <em>vulgus</em> is not only quantitative, but also qualitative, especially when it comes to its semantic nuances and combinatorial profile. Focusing one after the other in a contrastive way on the phenomenological, sociological and ethological dimensions of the crowds depicted by Tacitus, we show that, while <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em> refer to strongly spatialized crowds, whose social composition does not seem to be a strong defining factor, usually without any own opinion or political autonomy, <em>vulgus</em> refers in Tacitus to a “popular” crowd, defined by its ability to vocalize its own feelings and opinion and to engage in dialogue, or even conflict, with the ruling elites. The <em>vulgus</em> thus seems to become, in Tacitus’ narrative, a new political actor of the imperial regime. Contrary to the institutional <em>populus</em>, the <em>vulgus</em> as political actor does not express its opinion through the ordinary political institutions that were traditionally controlled by the Roman aristocracy (the <em>comitia</em> for instance), but proceeds to do so through vocalizations in non-institutional (albeit deeply political) contexts.</p>

      <div><p>Crowd behaviour in the Antiquity have received little scholarly attention, even though ancient authors (prose writers as well as poets) very regularly mention mass phenomena. The major works of the last fifty years on the Roman <em>plebs</em>, which we owe to <em>Yavetz 1969</em>, <em>Millar 1998</em> or <em>Courrier 2014</em>, focus on the political culture of the sub-equestrian segments of Roman society, without centrally examining crowd movements. Few historical studies address head-on the question of the definition of crowds in ancient societies: see some brief assessments in (<em>Gilbert 1976</em> pp. 7-16, <em>Laser 1997</em> pp. 17-18, or more recently <em>Laignoux 2011</em>, and on the side of literary studies, the panoramas of <em>Karpyuk 2000</em> or <em>Baier 2010</em> and Engel’s still useful monograph on collective psychology in Tacitus <em>Engel 1972</em>. Some insights can be found in studies on close related themes, like R. Ash’s monograph on the behaviour of the legions in Tacitus’ <em>Histories</em> <em>Ash 1999</em>.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">13</div>
      <div><p>This scarcity can be explained by the little scientific value given to the concept of crowd in historical studies: the notion seems to be irremediably linked to the psychological, not to say &quot;psychopathological&quot;, approach that characterized its emergence in the scientific field at the end of the 19th century. The famous studies of Le Bon and Tarde, whose ideological positioning as much as results are unanimously rejected today (cf. <em>Thiec, Tréanton 1983</em>), have cast doubt on the operability of the notions of &quot;crowd&quot; or &quot;mass&quot;, which hardly find any echo today elsewhere than in the field of social psychology (see <em>Reicher 2001</em>). Moreover, scholars working on ancient societies now generally resort to the tools of the history from below, which leave aside the question of group psychology to focus on the social life of actors and the (economic, social, political) motives of collective action: among several examples, see the recent collective publication of the research group <a href="http://gsppa.fflch.usp.br/en/presentation," title="Link to the project presentation on the University of São Paulo website">“The Subaltern and the Popular in Antiquity”</a> with the forthcoming <em>Courrier, Oliveira 2021</em>, and, on our topic, but on a later period, the recent thorough analysis of <em>Magalhães de Oliveira 2020</em>.</p>

      <div><p>This relative lack of interest is often accompanied by a distrust of the vocabulary of ancient authors. The well-known aristocratic bias of our sources often leads to the rejection of any in-depth study of the vocabulary relating to crowds, and in the first place the various denominations they receive in the texts. Since Z. Yavetz, an eminent specialist in the Roman <em>plebs</em>, it is considered that the lexical variations that authors use to designate crowds are essentially explained by the concern for <em>variatio</em> or by the moral colour they seek to give to a collective demonstration. To quote three passages of Yavetz's study (<em>Yavetz 1969</em>, p. 142, p. 147 &amp; p. 149 ) :</p>

<p>It has been stated above that the term <em>vulgus</em> is expressive of an outstandingly derogatory attitude. The <em>vulgus</em> implies the ordinary public that is aggressive, fickle, superstitious, destitute of everything spiritual and material. It is consequently easy to mislead them and incite them to rebellion. When the ancients use the expression <em>vulgus</em>, they not only convey a fact but also an attitude.</p>

<p>It seems that most of the above-mentioned expressions are used indiscriminately. It should
not, however, be forgotten that when one says that <em>vulgus</em>, ὄχλος, ὅμιλος, or <em>turba</em> have a derogatory significance, it means that for the ancients, and especially Tacitus, the criterion is not legal or social, but moral (his own moral criterion, naturally).</p>

      <div><p>Such a definitive judgement, which affirms the interchangeable nature of the vocabulary pertaining to crowds and masses, has been widely accepted by later historical studies (in <em>Virlouvet 1985</em> pp. 54-63 or <em>Courrier 2014</em> pp. 489-497, for example), and even radicalized by some, like J. P. Toner, who states categorically (<em>Toner 2009</em> p. 4): “Discussions about the exact meanings of Latin terms such as <em>populus</em>, <em>plebs</em>, <em>turba</em>, <em>multitudo</em> or <em>vulgus</em> are in danger of missing the point. It is hardly surprising that the elite failed to express themselves more clearly when talking about the non-elite because, to put it crudely, they didn’t give a damn about them.” The same tendency can be seen in <em>Kröss 2017</em> pp. 24-68, a more thorough study of the term <em>plebs</em> in the literary texts, whose conclusions yet maintain the idea that the word used by ancient authors to refer to the urban masses does not really have one clear and definite received meaning.</p>

      <div><p>However, rare lexicological studies have shown how inspiring and interesting a comprehensive analysis of the vocabulary of the crowd could prove to be in order to understand the evolution of mental representations on this topic. These studies usually focus on shorter corpora (one author), like Seneca <em>Arena 2007</em> or Suetonius <em>Mouchová 1991</em>. Regarding Tacitus, R. F. Newbold’s study on the Tacitean <em>vulgus</em> <em>Newbold 1976</em>, which rightly emphasizes the importance of lexicological analysis, proves yet disappointing: apart from its brevity, the occurrences are not detailed, which does not allow any data control and, more generally, denies any close reading. This is all the more problematic as the author’s heuristic categories are not self-evident: for example, why and how the distinction is made (p. 86) between the <em>vulgus</em> referring to the whole population of Rome, to the lower classes only, to those same classes not constituted as “a crowd or a mob”, or to “public opinion anywhere” (an undefined concept, while far from self-evident, cf. <em>Rosillo-López 2017</em>), remains unclear. Moreover, as we will try to demonstrate here, a study of the <em>vulgus</em> in Tacitus cannot do without a confrontation with other denominations of the crowd (<em>turba</em>, <em>multitudo</em>), nor a comparison, at least qualitative, with more institutional designations of the civic body such as <em>populus</em> and <em>plebs</em>. This is what I propose to do here, by summarizing and enriching through digital tools the reflections presented in the first part of my doctoral thesis (<em>Autin 2019</em> pp. 17-117).</p>

      <div><p>In this scientific context, philologists can provide a new impetus by attempting to uncover the thought patterns of ancient authors, without, however, pronouncing on their own historical value. Indeed, if the notion of crowd no longer seems to have scientific relevance, the frequency with which crowd phenomena appear in ancient literature shows their centrality in ancient representations of collective action. What I propose to do in this paper is to shed light on “Tacitus’ sociology” rather than on the “sociology of the crowds” itself, to paraphrase V. Hunter’s words on Thucydides <em>Hunter 1988</em>. My thesis here is that the clearly psychologizing colour of the notion of crowd in Tacitus, as well as the discrediting vision that is usually associated with it, is not incompatible with the use of a precise vocabulary, itself shaped by Tacitus’ subtle analysis of crowd behaviour on the sociological and political levels. I will thus engage in the work of disintegration recommended by E. Flaig who, nearly thirty years ago, showed the permanent gap, among ancient historians, between the topical discourse against subaltern groups and the reality of the narrative, which is often more “objective” (cf. <em>Flaig 2019</em>, first edition 1992).</p>

      <div><p>This study will focus on the surviving works of Tacitus, a Roman historian of the late 1st/early 2nd  century AD. His two most important historiographical works, the <em>Annals</em> and the <em>Histories</em>, provide a most valuable testimony for the understanding of the early Empire, from the death of Augustus in 14 AD until the accession to power of the Flavians following the civil war of AD 68-69, with substantial lacunae due to the transmission of texts. To these major works, three opuscules should be added, the <em>Life of Agricola</em>, which preserves a significant record of Domitian’s reign, as well as the <em>Germania</em> and the <em>Dialogue on Oratory</em>, which do not belong primarily to the historiographical genre, yet contain several characterizations of the crowds, respectively from an ethnographic and rhetorical perspective. A careful observer of the institutional and political transformations of the early Empire, Tacitus makes a very singular use of the vocabulary of the crowds compared to his predecessors and contemporaries, as I shall explain further on in this paper (see below mainly sections 3 and 4).</p>

      <div><p>I will provide an exhaustive analysis of the three main lexemes referring to the crowd in Tacitus (and, more broadly, in Latin), that is, in alphabetical order, <em>multitudo</em>, <em>turba</em> and <em>vulgus</em> (usually translated by “crowd”, “mass”, “throng”, etc.). It is, of course, possible to find in Tacitus other words to refer to crowds. However, they are much less common and the meaning of “crowd” is clearly secondary: this is the case, for example, of <em>vis</em>, whose primary meanings are “strength” and “violence”, but does refer to a collective mobilization in Tacitus, <em>Ann.</em>, 12.29.3. An overview of these lesser terms is given by <em>Engel 1972</em> pp. 700-705. Moreover, some crowd movements are evoked through specific constructions (impersonal passive, indefinite pronouns, etc.), but taking these cases into account would lead this paper away from the lexicological study which it aims at.</p>

<ul>
<li>when a lexeme refers to an inanimate collection (<em>eg</em> the <em>multitudo legum</em>, &quot;multitude of laws&quot;, in Tac., <em>Ann.</em> , 3.25.2);</li>
<li>
when a lexeme is used in a meaning other than &quot;crowd&quot;: <ul>
<li>meaning of &quot;trouble/disorder&quot; with <em>turba</em>, exclusively in the plural form in Tacitus (see Tac., <em>Hist.</em> 1.83.1, 2.72.3, 4.1.8, 4.70.8, <em>Ann.</em> 1.16.1 and 1.19.2, cf. <em>Gerber, Greef, John 1962</em> <em>s. u.</em>);</li>
<li>meaning of &quot;large number&quot; with <em>multitudo</em>, especially the passages in which <em>multitudo</em> is used in an instrumental or causal structure (<em>eg</em> <em>multitudine</em> meaning “because of their high number” see Tac., <em>Hist.</em> , 1.8.1, 3.30.1, 4.50.7, 5.12.6, <em>Ann.</em> , 4.27.2, 4.55.3, 14.61.1).</li>

Our method is, of course, a simplification, since, on the one hand, a single lexeme often contains several semantic features, and, on the other hand, assigning a semantic feature to a word is not always obvious. For instance, considering the term rumor (“rumour”), which often collocates with <em>vulgus</em>, we could choose as the main semantic feature “vocalization” as well as “opinion” (the latter was ultimately the one we went for). However, this approach shows stimulating results for discriminating between <em>multitudo</em>, <em>turba</em> and <em>vulgus</em> (see below, section 3.2.1).</p>

For such cases of crowds related to a specific historical framework (unlike the <em>vulgus</em> in Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 3.61.1 above) but whose concrete manifestation is somehow blurred or imprecise (unlike the <em>multitudo</em> in Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 1.27.2), we used the <code>0.5</code> tag.</p>

Crowd agency might take the form of political demands in the crowd, of political actions against the authorities, and more generally implies the maintenance in the crowd of political autonomy, distinct from the views of the authorities (on this topic, <em>Logghe 2017</em>). Mutiny narratives in Tacitus often display crowd manifesting strongly their agency, for example in this passage (Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 1.39.3), which received the highest tag of our tagset (<code>1</code>):</p>

</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">76</div>
      <div><p>To discriminate between <em>vulgus</em>, <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em>, the first approach can be an etymological one. The etymology leads to set for the first time in this paper a dividing line between the first term on the one hand, and the second and the third one on the other hand. <em>Turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em> are in fact distinguished from <em>vulgus</em> by their polysemy. <em>Turba</em>, probably a loanword from gr. ἡ τύρβη, originally means &quot;trouble&quot; (cf. <em>Ernout, Meillet 2001</em> <em>s. u.</em>); applied to crowds, it designates human gatherings as chaotic and disturbing phenomena (in the eyes of the aristocrats that the Roman authors mostly are). <em>Multitudo</em>, which, of course, derives from <em>multus</em> (“many”), generally refers to a large number of elements, not necessarily individuals. In contrast, <em>vulgus</em> is of obscure origin: as the term does not seem to have parallels in the Indo-European languages, some linguists think that it was first used in the rural domain, where it would have designated a herd of animals, like <em>pecus</em>, before being applied to the Roman plebs at the end of the 2nd century BC, at the time of the rural exodus of the <em>plebs rustica</em>. This theory, which is not new, as recalled by <em>Ernout, Meillet 2001</em> <em>s. u.</em>, has been supported by <em>Biliński 1964</em> and taken up by <em>Engel 1972</em> p. 292 n. 1. It seems therefore that the meaning of “crowd” is much more central in <em>vulgus</em> than in <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em>, and that by its gregarious nature, <em>vulgus</em> would represent the crowd from the psychological point of view (a collection of people whose individuality has dissolved into the mass), which proves right when we take a further look at Tacitus’ writing (see below, section 4.1).</p>

      <div><p><em>Analysis</em>: We observe a roughly equal distribution for <em>vulgus</em> between the two major works of Tacitus, and two diametrically opposed distributions between <em>multitudo</em> and <em>turba</em>, the first lexeme being more present in the Annals, the second in the Histories. However, we must take into account that these three subcorpora have a very variable number of words: 88,905 words for the Annals, 51,495 words for the Histories and, in total, 21,562 words for the opuscules. It is therefore necessary to correlate the total number of occurrences of the lexemes to the number of words in each subcorpus in order to get a more accurate idea of their distribution within the works of Tacitus: this is the purpose of the heatmap (<a href="#figure-3">figure 3</a>) below.</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">95</div>
      <div><p>The dominant use of <em>vulgus</em> within the Tacitean corpus must be confronted with the distribution of the three lexemes in the more general framework of the preserved classical Latin literature. To do so, it is possible to rely on the <a href="http://hyperbase.unice.fr/">Hyperbase web tool</a>, developed within the University of Nice’s research team <em>Bases, Corpus, Langages</em>, in its 2017 web version (on the use of this tool by classicists, see <em>Fantoli, Vandersmissen 2019</em>). This platform allows us to investigate the distribution of the three lexemes within the Latin textual bank of the Liège research team LASLA. Even if this corpus of roughly two million words does not cover the whole of Latinity (see <em>Longrée, Philippart de Foy, Purnelle 2010</em> pp. 433-435), it provides a sense of Tacitus’ originality, by comparing him to 21 classical authors, mainly his predecessors, from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD, in prose as well as in poetry.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">96</div>
      <div><p><em>Method</em>: the LASLA corpus has first been redrawn within Hyperbase Web to group the works by author; the authors have then been classified in chronological order, in order to bring out diachronic evolutions (which eventually did not prove conclusive). We then queried Hyperbase web on the distribution of the three lexemes within the corpus, choosing as “context” the sentence (in connection with our treatment of the Tacitean corpus, see above, section 1.3.2) and as “unit” the specificity score. The generated file (<code>XLS</code> re-exported in <code>CSV</code>), without the “Total” column, is displayed in the form of a heatmap (<a href="#figure-4">figure 4</a>).</p>

      <div><p><em>Analysis</em>: We must obviously take into account the generic specificities of the authors listed. Regarding the poets, for instance, the metrical structure of the hexameter and the pentameter makes it impossible to use the word <em>multitudo</em>. With this remark in mind, the results shown in <a href="#figure-4">figure 4</a> speak for themselves. In most of the historians and biographers (Caesar, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Sallust, Curtius), we notice sometimes very marked preference (in Caesar in particular) for the lexeme <em>multitudo</em>. In Suetonius, the specificity score is highest for the lexeme <em>turba</em>. In the case of Tacitus, particularly noteworthy is his preferential use of the lexeme <em>vulgus</em>, which isolates him not only within the sub-corpus of historiographers, but also on the scale of the entire LASLA text bank. There is thus a first quantitative specificity of <em>vulgus</em> within the Tacitean corpus and, more generally (even if the corpus used does not allow us to affirm this definitely), within the Latinity.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>First of all, there are divergent variations between the morphological label and the syntactic label.

This is simply due to the fact that the subject function can be occupied in Latin by nominatives, accusatives in infinitive clauses (accusative and infinitive) and ablatives in participle clauses (ablative absolute).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a contrastive perspective, we note:</p>
<ul>
<li>that <em>vulgus</em> preferentially occupies the <code>SBJ</code> (subject) and <code>ATR</code> functions (attributive, <em>ie</em> apposition, possessive/objective/partitive constructions);</li>
<li>that <em>multitudo</em> preferentially assumes the <code>SBJ</code> or <code>OBJ</code> functions (object, <em>ie</em> direct or indirect object as well as passive agents);</li>
<li>that <em>turba</em> follows a distribution close to <em>multitudo</em>, with, however, a dominant <code>OBJ</code> function;</li>
<li>that the <code>ADV</code> function (adverbial, <em>ie</em> generally the lexemes in oblique cases specifying the circumstances of the action, except for the passive agent) is not a relevant criterion to contrast the three lexemes.</li>

      <div><p>A first contrastive phraseological approach of the three nouns had been tried in 2016 within the Phraseotext project by K. Bouzidi, O. Kraif, J. Sorba and myself <em>Autin, Bouzidi, Kraif, Sorba 2016</em>. The aim was then to bring out the combinatorial profile of these lexical units, that is to study the stereotypical semantic and syntactic associations of each of these terms, using the <a href="http://phraseotext.u-grenoble3.fr/lexicoscope/">Lexicoscope</a>, a tool that extracts the most representative collocates of a given pivotal term <em>Kraif, Diwersy 2014</em>. This study focused on a larger corpus than the present paper, since it included, alongside Tacitus, several late Republican and imperial prose writers; it was also mainly conceived as a exploratory approach, since the automatic, data-driven dependency parsing of our corpus (through a stochastic parser) involved a not negligible error rate. However, several interesting results had emerged in this preliminary study. Indeed, the collocates (<em>ie</em> the stereotypical co-occurrents) of <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em> convey in this corpus mainly the semantic features /intensity/ (<em>ingens</em>, <em>magnus</em>, <em>tantus</em>) and /movement/ (<em>circumfundo</em>, <em>concito</em>, <em>effundo</em>, <em>convenio</em>, <em>traduco</em>), while <em>vulgus</em> is mainly associated with abstract terms and nouns of opinion and/or speech (<em>rumor</em>, <em>opinio</em>, <em>favor</em>, <em>sermo</em>). Combining colligation and collocation analyses (<em>Legallois 2012</em> pp. 45-50), we also observed in this paper that <em>multitudo</em> and <em>turba</em> were in about one case out of two complements of control verbs (<em>agere</em>, <em>circumdare</em>, <em>cogere</em>, etc.), while this type of association was much rarer for <em>vulgus</em> (one case out of five). It was thus possible to infer an opposition between, on the one hand, <em>multitudo</em> and <em>turba</em> – the crowd observed in its concrete, physical, spatial realization, and hence considered as a whole that can be controlled, manipulated, gathered or dispersed – and, on the other hand, <em>vulgus</em> – the crowd as a single entity, thinking with a single mind, speaking with a single voice, and whose opinion remains largely autonomous and can hardly be controlled. This first morphosyntactic approach can be completed by the comparison of the phraseological profile of the three lexemes in Tacitus, <em>ie</em> by studying the terms with which these lexemes are preferentially associated within the Tacitean corpus.</p>

The collocates of <em>turba</em> bring out the features /movement/, but also /mixture/, /military/, and we note recurrent, but less frequent, associations with the /conflict/, /disorder/, /spatiality/ and /vocalization/ features. <em>Vulgus</em> collocates with lexical items associated with the semantic feature /opinion/, with a strong presence of /vocalization/ and terms describing a state of the crowd, like stative verbs (/stative/).</p>

All three lexemes are mostly associated with unique collocates. However, the density estimation shows that the number of unique collocates is much higher for <em>multitudo</em> than for <em>turba</em> and <em>vulgus</em>. More interestingly, <em>vulgus</em> is the only term to have collocates that appear more than twice, and even has a collocate that occurs 15 times in the Tacitean corpus.

There are also several instances of <em>vulgus</em> where it is difficult to specify whether it refers to one or the other type of crowd, sometimes because of the general nature of the assertion (<em>eg</em> in phrases such as <em>vulgus putat/credit</em>, “the common people thinks/believes that…”), or when Tacitus describes a strand of public opinion which, in the context, could be assigned, in Rome, either way to civilians or praetorians (<em>eg</em> for the popularity of Piso in Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 15.48.2).

      <div><p><em>Analysis</em>: The criterion of the sociological composition of the crowd seems to be the most decisive so far to discriminate between the three lexemes. <em>multitudo</em> and even more <em>turba</em> are frequently used to refer to heterogeneous gatherings, where commoners and aristocrats mingle with one another indiscriminately, especially in crisis periods. <em>Vulgus</em> is never explicitly used to describe these phenomena and mostly refers to “popular” crowds, that is crowd of plebeians, in Rome (<em>Wellesley 1972</em> p. 177), or crowd of “common soldiers” (<em>gregarii milites</em>, Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.36.3, 1.46.4, 3.31.2), distinguished from the prefects and the legates (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 2.70.5, 4.36–37, 4.57, <em>Ann.</em>, 1.49.2), from the tribunes and the centurions (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.36.3, 1.80.2, 2.5.4, 3.31.2, <em>Ann.</em>, 1.17–18, 2.55.5),  and even sometimes from the “junior officers” below centurion rank, the <em>principales</em>, soldiers on higher pay with special duties, and thus standing out from the pack of common soldiers (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.25.2, see a more thorough analysis of this point in <em>Autin 2019</em> pp. 98-99).</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">167</div>
      <div><p>To take the example of the crisis of the 15 January 69 AD, when Otho carried out a coup in Rome against Galba, the legitimate emperor, Tacitus mentions a first crowd movement caused by the (false) news of Otho’s death: a euphoric crowd formed in front of the imperial palace and forced the doors to congratulate Galba. Tacitus particularly insists on the social diversity of this crowd, composed by “not the people only and the ignorant mob […] but many of the knights and senators as well” (<em>non populus tantum et imperita plebs [...] sed equitum plerique ac senatorum</em>, Tac, <em>Hist.</em>, 1.35.1), and ends up calling it an <em>inruens turba</em> (an “inrushing crowd”): <em>turba</em> here undoubtedly refers to a (socially) mixed crowd, with citizens belonging to the highest orders and commoners. A few hours later, after Galba’s death and Otho’s victory, a crowd of the same social diversity forms in an undetermined place (the forum?) to deplore the dramatic turn of events. <em>Vulgus</em> appears in this second passage, not to designate this heterogeneous gathering of citizens (therefore in contrast to <em>turba</em>), but to refer to its popular component alone. It is thus superimposed on the <em>populus</em> et <em>plebs</em> of the former passage of Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.35.1. See in Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.50.1: “Then [the thought of the civil war] […] caused open grief not only to the senators and knights who had some share and interest in the state, but even to the common people (<em>vulgus</em>).” (<em>Tum [...] non senatus modo et eques, quis aliqua pars et cura rei publicae, sed <strong>vulgus</strong> quoque palam maerere</em>, Tac, <em>Hist.</em>, 1.50.1) The proximity of the two passages makes clear the sociological difference between <em>turba</em> and <em>vulgus</em> in Tacitus’ mind, and it is misleading to state that <em>vulgus</em> could refer to any form of “foule mêlée” in his works (<em>pace</em> <em>Engel 1972</em> pp. 29 &amp; 74 or <em>Newbold 1976</em> pp. 86-88).</p>

      <div><p>The graph of <a href="figure-13">fig. 13</a> shows the numerical importance of the occurrences for which it is impossible to specify further the social composition of the crowd. However, it is also significant that the lexemes chosen by Tacitus when he refers to crowds composed exclusively of noble citizens or non–citizens (labels <code>eli</code> and <code>n-civ</code>) are exclusively <em>multitudo</em> and <em>turba</em>, and that <em>vulgus</em> never appears in these sense. We may thus infer that neither <em>turba</em> nor <em>multitudo</em> were associated, for Tacitus, with a specific sociological profile, unlike <em>vulgus</em>, which was strictly associated to the sub-equestrian segments of the civic body (in Rome or elsewhere). Compare in contrast, a few chapters apart, the <em>turba populi</em> (“crowd of commoners”) of Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 2.88.3 with the <em>turba nobilium</em> (“crowd of nobles”) of Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 2.92.2. Conversely, expressions such as <em>vulgus populi</em> or <em>vulgus nobelium</em> never appear in Tacitus, and sound odd to anyone familiar with Tacitus’ writing.</p>

In contrast, <em>vulgus</em> is much more “intransitive” than <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em>, and is much more used as possessive of a noun (<em>fauor vulgi</em>, “the favour of the crowd”; <em>studia vulgi</em>, “the inclination of the crowd”; <em>rumor vulgi</em>, “the rumour of the crowd”...) than it is itself determined by another term. </p>

      <div><p>The detailed analysis of lexical echoes is enlightening on the near-synonymy of <em>vulgus</em> and the “institutional” vocabulary referring to the common people (<em>populus</em>, “the common people”; <em>plebs</em>, “the plebs”). For stylistic reasons – to avoid repetition or to produce a form of copia – Tacitus is often led to use <em>vulgus</em>, <em>populus</em> and/or <em>plebs</em> as synonyms, which clearly shows that <em>vulgus</em> was the lexeme closest in his mind to the traditional terms referring to the Roman people (on these lexical connections, see <em>Yavetz 1969</em>, p. 148-149). Several passages go so far as to present the three lexemes <em>populus</em>, <em>plebs</em> and <em>vulgus</em> together (already before Tacitus, see Stac., <em>Theb.</em> , 1.168–170). The most revealing text is the report of Germanicus’ triumph in 17 AD. Tacitus slips into the narrative of this highly positive event a srong dysphoric foreshadowing of Germanicus’ imminent death (Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 2.41.3):</p>

The opuscules and the first book of the Histories contain numerous hendiadyses related to the social stratification of the common people of Rome. <em>populus et plebs</em> (“the people and the <em>plebs</em>”) for instance occurs in a small number of occurrences in the preserved Latin literature, mainly in Tacitus (cf. <em>Yavetz 1969</em> p. 149) and already in Cicero (cf. <em>Knopf 2018</em> pp. 31–33). <em>Vulgus et populus</em> (“the crowd and the people” = “the crowd of the people”) appears three times in Tacitus’ early works (Tac., <em>Dial.</em>, 7.3, <em>Agr.</em>, 43.1 and <em>Hist.</em>, 1.89.1). In these phrases, it is impossible to analyse <em>vulgus</em> and <em>populus</em> as referring to two distinct realities, since the group the historian is talking about is characterized before or after the passage by a simple <em>vulgus</em> (Tac., <em>Agr.</em>, 41.4) or by <em>plebs</em> (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.89.1). Without going further into this matter, which we propose to deal with <a href="https://www.msh-alpes.fr/actualites/populi-nomen-nommer-peuple-romain-en-latin-et-en-grec">elsewhere</a>, it seems that the hendiadys <em>vulgus et populus</em> allows Tacitus to provide two complementary perspectives on the same object, the common people of Rome (see further interpretation below, section 4.2).</p>

      <div><p><em>Analysis</em>: The study of the distribution according to the degree of spatialization of the crowd provides convincing results to discriminate between the three lexemes. Indeed, while this is not a decisive criterion for understanding the distribution of <em>vulgus</em> in the Tacitean corpus, <em>turba</em> and even more <em>multitudo</em> are strongly associated with clearly spatialized crowds, <em>ie</em> crowds whose inscription in a given place (and time) is an important definitional feature. This observation is consistent with the one made above on the semantics of the collocates of these two lexemes (see above, section 3.2.1).</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">182</div>
      <div><p>Besides, this spatial criterion is hardly satisfactory to account for the occurrences of <em>vulgus</em>. Very often in Tacitus, the <em>vulgus</em> is a crowd whose behaviour is inscribed in a very loose spatial or temporal framework. A revealing example is given by the crowd (<em>vulgus</em>) that longs for Agricola to take new military responsibilities after his retirement from public life (Tac., <em>Agr.</em>, 41.4). In his narrative, Tacitus summarizes events that occurred in Rome over the course of several years:</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">185</div>
      <div><p>Thus, in most of the passages where rumours or demands of this Roman <em>vulgus</em> are mentioned, the spatial inscription of the crowd is so to speak non–existent. The Tacitean <em>vulgus</em> often falls into one of the categories of the Stoic ontology, namely the <em>distantia corpora</em>, entities built up of distant, non-continuous elements, as opposed to <em>continua corpora</em> (entities made up of a single piece) and <em>composita corpora</em> (entities built up of heterogeneous, but continuous elements). Seneca thus contrasts the human body (<em>corpus continuum</em>), a ship (<em>corpus compositum</em>) and human groups such as the Senate, the army or the people (<em>corpus ex distantibus</em>) in a letter to Lucilius (Sen., <em>Epist.</em>, 102.6, see on the philosophical background here <em>Meijer 1988</em> pp. 63-69; many thanks to Fabien Pepino for drawing my attention to these notions). Admittedly, <em>vulgus</em> is also used by Tacitus to refer to the public of spectacles, assemblies (<em>contiones</em>), especially military ones, and other specific places, all of which have in common that they had become spaces of communication and interaction between the Roman plebs and the political (imperial) power, as we will see below (section 4.2). In these cases, however, Tacitus almost never puts the focus on the spatialization of the crowd, as the collocates of <em>vulgus</em> generally belong to the semantic field of opinion and speech (see above, section 3.2.1). Unlike <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em>, the criterion of spatialization clearly appears as incidental to defining what <em>vulgus</em> is in the eyes of the historian.</p>

      <div><p>As is often the case, the passages combining several of the lexemes studied are most telling. For instance, during Vitellius’ desperate conscription at the end of the civil war of 69 AD, Tacitus distinguishes between the <em>vulgus</em>, synonymous with <em>populus</em>, to refer to the crowd proclaiming its support for the emperor in a unspecified place and time, and the <em>multitudo</em>, which rushes into the <em>comitia tribute</em> on the day of the conscription, where the multitude “overflew” the place (<em>superfluente multitudine</em>). The opposition between a strongly spatialized crowd (<em>multitudo</em>) and an undefined, almost “uncircumstanced” crowd (<em>vulgus</em>) speaks for itself (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 3.58):</p>

      <div><p><em>Analysis</em>: This last criterion also proves to be of primary importance in a contrastive perspective. <em>vulgus</em> seems preferred as the represented crowd gains agency and steps up its political demands. Conversely, <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em>, in similar proportions, are mostly used for quiet and non-politicized crowds. A few examples should allow us to see how these general observations are anchored in the more detailed analysis of Tacitus’ text.</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">194</div>
      <div><p>It is well known that ancient historiography does not focus on everyday practices, which ancient historians considers unworthy of serious attention. However, it should be stressed that in the two passages in which Tacitus refers to the everyday masses swarming in the streets of Rome, he uses <em>turba</em> (<em>Hist.</em>, 2.88.3) and <em>multitudo</em> (<em>Hist.</em>, 1.75.3). In this case, the crowd considered is a transient group of individuals whose common presence in the same place at the same time is only circumstantial. The same two lexemes appear to refer to “professional crowds”, <em>ie</em> groups of individuals constituted for the exercise of a corporate or professional activity and politically insignificant, <em>eg</em> the “crowd of devotees” (<em>turba sacricolarum</em>, <em>Hist.</em>, 3.74.1), a gathering constituted by priests of Isis who transport the objects of the Isiac cult from the Campus Martius to the other side of the Tiber. It is also noticeable that <em>multitudo</em> is mostly chosen to describe politically or institutionally important crowds, but passive (<em>eg</em> <em>Hist.</em>, 4.81.3) or lacking political autonomy (most notably the crowds following a patron, <em>eg</em> <em>Ann.</em>, 4.41.3, 13.14.1). To cite a representative example, when Germanicus goes to Artaxata in 18 AD to crown the pro-Roman prince Zeno-Artaxias king of Armenia, the historian emphasizes the new ruler’s favour with both the nobility (<em>proceres</em>) and the people (<em>plebs</em>). The coronation scene itself enlightens this rare concord. The people appear as <em>multitudo</em>, but are depicted as a most passive crowd (<em>Ann.</em>, 2.56.3):</p>

      <div><p><em>Analysis</em>: The active and decisive support of the “consenting noblemen” (<em>adprobantibus nobilibus</em>) is followed by the passive and symbolic support of the “crowd around” (<em>circumfusa multitudine</em>), which has no say in the matter, but is presented from the perspective of spatiality and number; it assumes a figurative function, which is certainly important in the political ritual, but lacks any effective weight.</p>

      <div><p>In contrast, the <em>vulgus</em> is a crowd whose raison d’être is almost always political and, above all, which exists through political action. We have seen above that collocates of <em>vulgus</em> implies the existence of a common opinion (<em>studium</em>, <em>favor</em>, <em>credere</em>, <em>rumor</em>...), shared feelings (<em>ira</em>, <em>gaudium</em>, <em>maerere</em>...), and collective vocalization (<em>sermo</em>, <em>clamor</em>, <em>uox</em>, <em>adstrepere</em>, <em>appellare</em>, <em>iactare</em>...). The <em>vulgus</em> thus has something to say and to demand. From the rumours that circulate in the streets of Rome to the shouts let out during circus games and other entertainments, the <em>vulgus</em> is not satisfied with a walk-on part like the <em>multitudo</em> mentioned earlier but strives to take a genuinely participatory part in the political field: it subverts the political structures and takes advantage of any opportunity to assert its interests – in a word, it expresses collective agency.</p>

At the same time, unwilling either to enfeeble his influence by prohibiting the throngs which besieged his doors or to give a handle to his detractors by receiving them, he turned to the idea of inducing Tiberius to spend his days in some pleasant retreat at a distance from Rome. The advantages, he foresaw, were numerous. Interviews would lie in his own bestowal; letters he could largely supervise, as they were transmitted by soldiers: before long, the Caesar, who was already in the decline of life and would be rendered laxer by seclusion, would be readier to transfer the functions of sovereignty; while his own unpopularity would diminish with the abolition of <strong>his great levées</strong>, and the realities of his power be increased by the removal of its vanities. Little by little, therefore, he began to denounce the drudgeries of the capital, its jostling crowds, <strong>the endless stream of suitors</strong>, and to give his eulogies to quiet and solitude, where tedium and bickering were unknown and a man’s chief attention could be centred on affairs of first importance.</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">204</div>
      <div><p>Tacitus begins by stating that the praetorian prefect is alarmed by &quot;the rumour of the crowd&quot; (<em>vulgi rumor</em>): <em>vulgus</em> thus designates a very large group, with few details on its concrete manifestation, a group able to make heard its opinion, which exerts a real constraining power over Sejanus. <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em> refer to narrower segments of the Roman population and characterize gatherings within a well determined context. The <em>turba</em> refers to the crowd that turned up for the official morning visit to the prince (<em>salutatio</em>) – thus presumably mostly composed of noble citizens (see <em>Winterling 1999</em> pp. 122-125 and <em>Hurlet 2001</em> pp. 178-180 on this topic) –, while the <em>multitudo</em> refers to the random crowds that formed around the emperor when he travelled through the city (see <em>Woodman 2018</em> p. 228 on Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 4.41.3 with references to Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 2.34.3). Admittedly, both the imperial <em>salutatio</em> and the emperor’s walkabout in the city have a political relevance, but more on a symbolic than on a really effective level, and above all they encapsulate top-down rather than bottom-up political practices. We should also note the syntactic variation between <em>vulgus</em>, which performs a determinative function and specifies the word “rumour” in the form of a possessive genitive (<em>rumor vulgi</em>), and, in contrast, <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em>, which are themselves specified through a determinative, in both cases a nominalized participle (<em>turba salutantum</em>, <em>multitudo adfluentium</em>). The determination of <em>turba</em> and <em>multitudo</em> through a nominalized participle in the form of a possessive genitive is recurrent in Tacitus (<em>Agr.</em>, 40.4, <em>Ann.</em>, 3.1.3, 6.16.3, 13.14.1), and can be read as a way to specify the referent of these so to speak  “floating signifier”, while associating them with precise circumstances. In fact, once the <em>salutatio</em> or the encounter with Tiberius in the streets of Rome is over, the crowd, whether <em>turba</em> or <em>multitudo</em>, is likely to break up, whereas the <em>vulgus</em> that circulates rumours overlaps (at least in Tacitus’ mind) with the urban <em>plebs</em> as a whole and does not seem solely linked to this particular occasion – the best evidence being that the same <em>vulgus</em> reappears a few paragraphs later (Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 4.64.1).</p>

      <div><p>Can we determine Tacitus’ originality in this particular use of <em>vulgus</em>? Although it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions without a comprehensive reading and analysis of parallel corpora, some selected comparisons with Tacitus’ predecessors, contemporaries and successors suggest that the historian made a quite original use of this lexeme, which one may link to his political analysis of the first principate.</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">207</div>
      <div><p>First of all, it should be noted that the very particular meaning Tacitus gives to <em>vulgus</em> (defined as a popular, politically active crowd, stating its opinion) is not unparalleled in the surviving Latin literature, but that the systematization of this definition is to our knowledge unprecedented. Indeed, from Sallust to Seneca, many authors give to <em>vulgus</em> the meaning of “mingled crowd” where the social orders and traditional distinctions are confused (Sall., <em>Cat.</em>, 20, or Sen., <em>Vit. Beat.</em>, 2.2 with the commentary of <em>Yavetz 1969</em> p. 150 n. 4), alongside those who give <em>vulgus</em> a clear “popular” colour (see for example the above-mentioned case of the hendiadys <em>populus and vulgus</em> in Cic., <em>Mur.</em>, 38, Cic., <em>Verr.</em>, 2.1.1, Lucius Pomponius Bononiensis <em>apud</em> Non. 3.750, and later Sen., <em>Phaedr.</em>, 488). In some earlier poets and prose writers, a distinction is made between the <em>turba</em> as a mixed crowd of all classes and the <em>vulgus</em> as the infra-equestrian part of it, as P. Arena has shown in relation to Ovid, Seneca or Statius <em>Arena 2007</em>. However, this definition of the <em>vulgus</em> is more fluctuating, for instance in a passage of Manilius in which the <em>vulgus</em> and the <em>sine nomine turba</em> (“nameless crowd”) designate the non-citizen fringes of the city, placed below the <em>populus</em> itself (Man. 5.733).</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">209</div>
      <div><p>In Suetonius, a contemporary of Tacitus who deals with the same historical material in a different genre (the biography), the most used lexeme is also <em>vulgus</em> (32 occ.), which, as in Tacitus, constitutes a singularity in relation to the previous literary production. However, the term does not have quite the same semantic extension as in Tacitus. We do find a number of passages in which the Suetonian <em>vulgus</em> designates the crowd as a new political actor of the imperial regime, as a type of manifestation of the urban <em>plebs</em> and as a participant in the dialogue with the prince (Suet., <em>Aug.</em> 45, <em>Claud.</em>, 21, <em>Ner.</em>, 21; link to rumours: <em>Iul.</em>, 30, <em>Tib.</em>, 7, <em>Ner.</em>, 6 and 53, <em>Oht.</em>, 12; link to opinion: <em>Iul.</em>, 88, <em>Ner.</em>, 4, 36 and 53, <em>Vesp.</em>, 14). Notwithstanding these occurrences, <em>vulgus</em> often refers to a socially indeterminate group and is often alluded to as the circles that circulate licentious verses or witty comments about the emperors (<em>Iul.</em>, 20, 80, <em>Tib.</em>, 21, <em>Ner.</em>, 42, <em>Vesp.</em>, 16). One thus often finds as collocates of this <em>vulgus</em> verbs referring to phonetic or lexical variants of certain nouns (<em>dicere</em>, <em>vocare</em>: <em>Aug.</em>, 35, 70, 87, <em>Tib.</em>, 38, 43, <em>Galb.</em>, 14, <em>Vesp.</em>, 4), while the verbal phrase <em>in vulgus</em>/<em>vulgo edere</em>/<em>exire</em> (which can be translated as “to divulge”) is found several times. In these cases, <em>vulgus</em> lacks the strong social colour it had in Tacitus. Furthermore, the parallel between the <em>vulgus urbanum</em> (“urban crowd”) and the <em>vulgus militum</em> (“military crowd”) is totally absent in Suetonius (in contrast to Tacitus), who never applies the noun to the military world, when he does not distinguish the civic and the military spheres most firmly (<em>eg</em> <em>Ner.</em>, 31).</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">210</div>
      <div><p><em>Turba</em> is used to nearly the same extent to <em>vulgus</em> (28 occ. in the sense of &quot;crowd&quot;), which makes a real difference with Tacitus. The term does not seem to have a strong social profile, since it refers sometimes to the Roman <em>plebs</em>, who attends the games or is entitled to the grain distributions (games : <em>Iul.</em>, 29, <em>Aug.</em>, 40, <em>Cal.</em>, 30, <em>Claud.</em>, 12, 27; frumentary context: <em>Claud.</em>, 18; around the curia: <em>Cal.</em>, 14; see also <em>Cal.</em>, 4 and <em>Galb.</em>, 18), sometimes to socially more diverse groups: senators, barbarians, slaves and soldiers (nobles: <em>Aug.</em>, 35, <em>Claud.</em>, 10, <em>Galb.</em>, 17, <em>Vit.</em>, 7; outside Rome / barbarians: <em>Aug.</em>, 98, <em>Ner.</em>, 30; slaves : <em>Claud.</em>, 18 and 22; soldiers: <em>Aug.</em>, 14, <em>Ner.</em> 2; in contrast, see two occurrences of <em>turba</em> paganorum, “crowd of civilians”: <em>Aug.</em>, 27 and <em>Galb.</em>, 19). The absence of a socially situated conceptualisation of the Suetonian <em>turba</em> is evident in the passages where <em>turba</em> refers to a mingled crowd, a <em>turba omnis generis</em> (“crowd of all ranks”, <em>Cal.</em>, 42) and, more generally, can be seen with the omnipresence of collocates in the genitive plural form, specifying to which kind of crowd the biographer refers to (<em>turba paganorum</em>, <em>creditorum</em>, <em>salutantum</em>, <em>familarum</em>, <em>operariorum</em>, etc.). These expressions underline the indeterminacy of this <em>turba</em>, which generally presents, as in Tacitus, a spatialized image of the crowd, and collocates with verbs of motion like <em>circumstare</em>, <em>dimouere</em>, <em>summovere</em>, etc.</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">211</div>
      <div><p>In spite of a smaller number of occurrences (12), <em>multitudo</em> also relates to various crowd phenomena: in addition to being used in more than a third of the cases for inanimate collections (<em>Iul.</em>, 68, <em>Aug.</em>, 29, <em>Ner.</em>, 31 and 46, <em>Tit.</em>, 4), <em>multitudo</em> refers as much to crowds without any claim of their own or without any homogeneous social profile as to the Roman plebs putting forward political demands (<em>Iul.</em>, 16, <em>Aug.</em>, 46, <em>Tib.</em>, 72, <em>Claud.</em>, 10).</p>

      <div><p>In Ammianus (a fourth century AD historian writing a continuation of Tacitus’ history), the distribution of lexemes is strikingly different. With 100 occurrences in which it actually designates human crowds, against 26 occurrences of inanimate collections, <em>multitudo</em> seems to be the term favoured by the historian to evoke crowd phenomena. The sheer volume of occurrences prevents any detailed study here, but we can highlight the diversity of crowd phenomena evoked by this noun: both urban and military crowds, Romans as well as barbarians, nobles as well as commoners. The high frequency of modifiers in the form of an explicative genitive (<em>multitudo calonum</em>, <em>pelicum</em>, <em>servorum</em>...) as well as expressions like <em>promiscua multitudo</em> (“mixed crowds”, “crowds without distinction”, Amm. 14.3.3, 19.6.1, 23.2.4) attest to this observation. The insistence on the physical dimension of the gathering is frequent, for instance through collocates such as <em>cogere</em> (“bring together”) or <em>circumsaepire</em> (“enclose”), and more generally verbs with prefixes <em>cum-</em> and <em>circum-</em> (Amm. 14.3.3, 16.10.4, 16.12.29, 18.2.8, 18.6.22, etc.).</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">214</div>
      <div><p><em>Turba</em> is mostly used in the plural form in its original sense of “trouble”, in noun phrases like _concitor <em>turbarum</em> (“troublemaker”, Amm. 14.7.15, 15.1.2, 15.7.5, 17.9.5, 19.4.6, etc.). The meaning of “crowd” is present in only 6 occ.; in theses cases, <em>turba</em> may refer to the lower end of the social scale, like the <em>turba imae sortis et paupertinae</em> of Amm. 14.6.25 (“crowd of lowest condition and greatest poverty”), but this social meaning occurs quite infrequently (compare Amm. 19.11.11, 21.10.1, 22.9.16, 23.6.83). With such a small number of relevant passages, it is difficult to reach general conclusions about Ammianus’ use of <em>turba</em>.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">215</div>
      <div><p>The occurrences of <em>vulgus</em> are also rather scarce in Ammianus (14 occ.). As in Suetonius, the term is likely to refer to large (and vague) segments of the population, especially when associated with verbs (<em>appellare</em>, <em>pronuntiare</em>) indicating popular variants of a word or pronunciation differences (Amm. 17.8.2, 22.4.9, 23.1.5; also 29.2.6). Apart from these cases, it is true that <em>vulgus</em> seems to have retained a clear social colour and characterizes collective actions taken together by the urban plebs (in Rome or in the major cities of the 4th century Roman Empire like Antioch or Milan) or by the legions (<em>vulgus</em> referring to the <em>plebs frumentaria</em> in Amm. 14.6.1; <em>vulgus</em> as the infantry in Amm. 16.12.49). As in Tacitus, <em>vulgus</em> is sometimes used to refer to particular sectors of public opinion (Amm. 23.6.4, 25.4.18). It is also worth noting that <em>vulgus</em> often appears in contexts of sedition, especially in urban settings (a clear link between <em>seditio</em> and <em>vulgus</em> is made in Amm. 14.6.1). In these cases, <em>vulgus</em> may be used alongside <em>plebs</em> and <em>multitudo</em>. In Amm. 14.7.5-6, a wheat riot begins within the plebs (<em>plebs</em>) of Antioch: the rioters are referred to as <em>multitudo</em> when they confine themselves to rumble, and as <em>vulgus</em> when the revolt breaks out. However, unlike in Tacitus, the <em>vulgus</em> usually appears as the social conflict is over, when some authority has calmed the crowd by appealing to their pity. The main actor in such events is usually the <em>plebs</em>, sometimes referred to as <em>multitudo</em> when they start rioting, then as <em>vulgus</em> when they settle down. This lexical sequence can be read, for example, in the narrative of the 355 AD seditions in Rome, suppressed by the urban prefect Flavius Leontius (Amm. 15.7). The choice of <em>vulgus</em> can be explained in these cases by its strong psychological dimension in general, and by the stereotypical affectivity of the masses in particular (see also Amm. 19.10.1-3, 30.8.9 and 31.5.7).</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">216</div>
      <div><p>Thus, Suetonius appears relatively close to Tacitus, especially in his use of <em>vulgus</em>, whereas in Ammianus, as in general in Latin literature, this term is very much in the minority compared to <em>multitudo</em> and <em>turba</em>. The differences between Tacitus and Suetonius can be explained by the latter’s less rigorous choice of lexemes to describe crowd action, or (perhaps more convincingly) by the biographical genre, in which the focus is put on urban life (hence the scarcity of military crowds). In these three authors, <em>vulgus</em> is clearly identified with the infra-equestrian classes of Roman society, and is associated with the expression of collective opinion.</p>

      <div><h2>Interpreting the results from a historical perspective: the Tacitean <em>vulgus</em>, a new imperial phenomenon?</h2>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">218</div>
      <div><p>Tacitus’ use of the three lexemes must be read in association with the diversity of crowd phenomena that occurred in the first century AD Rome. In this historical context, the historian specializes <em>vulgus</em> to refer to a type of crowd closely linked to the Roman plebs, defined by a collective opinion, capable of vocalizing it and, more generally, of stating its political demands – in short, a crowd that thinks and speaks. We have also seen above that Tacitus made a quantitatively important use of <em>vulgus</em>, superior to the previous literary production. In the final part of this paper, we propose to investigate this Tacitean originality from a more historical perspective. Two possible, not mutually exclusive interpretations might be advanced: the psychological nature of Tacitus’ writing and the evolution of the political relations within the Roman society of the 1st century AD.</p>

</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">220</div>
      <div><p>Because of its potential origin in the rural language, and at the very least because of the nominal suffix -us and the neutral gender, <em>vulgus</em> carries strong psychological connotations, allowing for broad generalizations about the gregarious nature of the crowd. The term must thus be apprehended within Tacitus’ broader tendency towards socio-psychological interpretation of the historical events, which is particularly clear if we look at the regular references in his works to the mos vulgi, the “habits” or even the psychological “laws of the crowd” (<em>Engel 1972</em> p. 707; <em>Aubrion 1985</em> pp. 226-237; see <em>Autin 2019</em> pp. 81-87 for a comprehensive survey). This set of rules allows the historian to explain crowd behaviour by invariants of psychic nature: crowds, whatever they are, are always unable to control themselves, fickle, prone to believe in the worst possible stories, gullible, etc. As such, the term is applied to diverse social groups – the Roman plebs, the legions, the common people of the <em>municipia</em> and the “barbarian” tribal populations –, all of which are subsumed under the general denomination of <em>vulgus</em>. Tacitus thus conflates in the same category the <em>vulgus urbanum</em> (“urban crowd” in Rome, the <em>Vrbs</em> <em>par excellence</em>, Tac, <em>Hist.</em>, 3.80.1), the <em>vulgus militum</em> (“military crowd”, Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 3.13.2, <em>Hist.</em>, 2.5.4 and 2.70.5), the <em>vulgus municipale</em> (“municipal crowd”, “crowd of the town”, Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 2.21, in Piacenza) and the <em>vulgus oppidanorum</em> (“provincial crowd”, with the same meaning of “crowd of the town”, Tac., <em>Ann.</em> 15.33.3, here in Naples). It is obvious that these groups have different social composition, privileges, powers and obligations. However, in Tacitus’ mind (and in the mind of any Roman aristocrat, one may add), each one of them forms an entity with similar characteristics (they are composed of non-noble freemen), whose behaviour, in a given situation, is unlikely to vary. </p>

      <div class="paragraph_num">221</div>
      <div><p>Some occurrences of <em>vulgus</em> used concurrently with <em>populus</em> and <em>plebs</em> show this difference between the political (<em>populus</em>, <em>plebs</em>) and the psychological vocabulary (<em>vulgus</em>). In a digression about Rome’s republican past, for example, Tacitus alludes to the ancient powers of the <em>plebs</em> (<em>plebs</em>): the chosen term can be explained by the reference to the secessions of the <em>plebs</em> in the early days of the Republic. In the very next phrase, when referring to the “character” (natura) of this group, Tacitus uses <em>vulgus</em>, a term more suited to his psychological approach (<em>Ann.</em> 4.33.2):</p>

In all of these cases, <em>vulgus</em> and <em>populus</em>/<em>plebs</em> refer to the same group, seen from two different (and complimentary) perspectives, one psychological, and one political or institutionnal.</p>

    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">226</div>
      <div><p>Nevertheless, it would be wrong to limit ourselves to this first analysis, since the <em>populus</em> and the <em>plebs</em> are often involved in Tacitus in psychologizing generalizations, and the distribution is sometimes the opposite of what one would expect (<em>eg</em> in Tacitus, Ann, 2.82.3, well noted in <em>Yavetz 1969</em> pp. 146 <em>sqq</em>). The reason why Tacitus has systematized the use of the notion of <em>vulgus</em> is undoubtedly also because it belongs fully to the political picture he draws on the early imperial Rome. We may start here by quoting a most revealing text. At the beginning of Otho’s reign in the first months of 69 AD, the people “obtained” (<em>impetrare</em>) the death of Tigellinus, Nero’s former praetorian prefect and favourite, protected under Galba by the powerful Titius Vinius. As he describes the collective mobilization that led to his downfall, Tacitus uses successively <em>populus</em> and <em>vulgus</em> (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.72.3):</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">227</div>

<p>These facts made <strong>the people</strong> more hostile towards him, and their old hatred was increased by their recent dislike for Titus Vinius. They rushed from every part of the city to the Palatine and the fora, and, pouring into the circus and theatres <strong>where the common people (<em>vulgus</em>) have the greatest licence</strong>, they broke out into seditious cries, until finally Tigellinus, at the baths of Sinuessa, receiving the message that the hour of his supreme necessity had come, amid the embraces and kisses of his mistresses, shamefully delaying his end, finally cut his throat with a razor, still further defiling a notorious life by a tardy and ignominious death.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">229</div>
      <div><p>At first glance, <em>vulgus</em> appears alongside Tacitus’ generalisation about the psychological disorder of the crowd, the <em>vulgi licentia</em> (“the licence of the crowd”), which he fiercely condemns. But the strong gnomic connotations of the passage invite us to look beyond the aristocratic disapproval of the collective action to analyse the narrative content. Indeed, as the historian notes here, in the 1st century AD Rome, the people (<em>populus</em>) expressed their demands in three places: the palace (<em>Palatium</em>), the imperial forums (<em>fora</em>), and the spectacles (circus and theatres, <em>circum ac theatre</em>), where they could be regarded as a crowd (<em>vulgus</em>). Behind the specific instance of Tigellinus’ downfall, the phraseology of the passage reveals to what extent the new forms of interaction between the plebs and the prince, especially at the games, had become a common practice regarding political relationships under the Empire. Indeed, as is well known, the places for popular gathering progressively shifted during the early Empire from the old republican spaces (especially the Forum) to the Palatine and to the monumental buildings where spectacles and games were held (see <em>Veyne 1976</em>, <em>Benoist 1999</em>, <em>Aldrete 1999</em> or <em>Gros 2005</em>, among other references). But this text also seems to echo a famous passage of Cicero’s <em>Pro Sestio</em> (Cic., <em>Sest.</em>, 106, commented by <em>Nicolet 1976</em> p. 482 or <em>Flaig 2003</em> pp. 237–239), a comparison which to our knowledge has so far gone unnoticed. In the latter, Cicero also presents three places where the <em>populus Romanus</em> expresses “their opinion and their will” (<em>iudicium ac uoluntas</em>): the meetings (<em>contiones</em>), the assemblies (<em>comitia</em>) and the games (<em>ludi et gladiatorum consessus</em>). If we compare Cicero’s judgement on the political situation at the end of the Republic with Tacitus’ analysis for the early imperial period, we notice that the historian only retains the spectacles from Cicero’s list, adding to them two other spaces of political gathering, the Palatine and the imperial forums.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">230</div>
      <div><p>Furthermore, it is worth noting that Tacitus, as expected, openly demonstrates utter contempt for the type of communication displayed by the crowd in games by referring to it as a form of <em>licentia</em> (“licence”). This <em>licentia</em> appears as a deterioration of Cicero’s reference to the <em>iudicium ac uoluntas</em> (“opinion and will”) of the people. Moreover, the political vocabulary has also deteriorated, as Cicero’s <em>populus Romanus</em> is first replaced in Tacitus by the simple <em>populus</em> and finally by <em>vulgus</em>. Yet, here again, the vocabulary is, in itself, ideological. Through this lexical evolution (<em>populus Romanus</em> in Cicero becoming <em>populus</em> and then <em>vulgus</em> in Tacitus), Tacitus points to the transformation of the political practices of the Roman <em>plebs</em>: they now make their feelings known outside the old institutional structures that were the assemblies (<em>contiones</em> and <em>comitia</em>). In so doing, the political authorities (now embodied by the emperor) found a new actor to dialogue with. It was no longer the old <em>populus Romanus</em>, who belonged to the expressions that the principate had “emptied of their meaning” and let “fall into disuse”, the <em>vacua</em> and <em>oblitterata nomina</em> (Tac., <em>Hist.</em> , 1.30.6 and 1.55.4), but of a new political entity, to which Tacitus gives the name of <em>vulgus</em>: a crowd holding and expressing an opinion, making demand in non-institutional spaces (through clamours at the games and rumours in the streets), and often obtaining satisfaction in this process. If we look back to Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 1.72.3, the <em>seditiosae voces</em> (“seditious cries”) of the crowd did compel Otho to condemn Tigellinus. In sum, the <em>vulgus</em> is a political actor whose public expression is achieved essentially through what Claude Nicolet called the “parallel languages” of politics (<em>“langages parallèles” de la politique</em>), thus designating the spaces situated “outside the traditional domain defined by public law” (especially the assemblies, see <em>Nicolet 1976</em> p. 456-505). Our comprehensive study of <em>vulgus</em> leads us to consider that Tacitus had perfectly perceived the transformation of political practices undergone at the turn of the millennium; in spite of the conspicuous display of contempt, he was fully aware of the centrality of these informal forms of politics in the first century AD, which scholars of Roman history have recently investigated with greater attention (see <em>Montlahuc 2020</em> relying on inspiring studies in Greek history like <em>Azoulay 2014</em>).</p>

</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">232</div>
      <div><p>Taking into account the three main lexemes of crowd, their lexical and syntactic environment as well as the historical phenomena they refer to, we can highlight the originality – and therefore, the interest – of the term <em>vulgus</em>. This specificity can be seen, first of all, in relation to <em>multitudo</em> and <em>turba</em>, two terms that are very close to each other. <em>vulgus</em> refers to highly conscious, active rather than passive or reactive gatherings. In Tacitus, it seems to co-refer with the notions of <em>populus</em> and <em>plebs</em> (themselves largely coreferential in the late Republican and early imperial prose, see <em>Hellegouarc'h 1963</em> pp. 506-518 and <em>Yavetz 1969</em> pp. 148-149), and thus to present a different facet from the same social group, the urban <em>plebs</em> (hence the hendiadys <em>vulgus ac populus</em> seen above). The most likely interpretation of this linguistic phenomenon is to link the <em>vulgus</em> to the new forms of gathering and political expression of the urban plebs that bypassed the old, sclerotic republican institutions, like voting, which had become mere “rituals” of assent <em>Hollard 2010</em>.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="paragraph mb5">
      <div class="paragraph_num">233</div>
      <div><p>Note, however, that Tacitus’ writing is resistant to definitive categorizations. For instance, rumours were one of the essential elements of the new dialogue between plebs and emperor (on this subject, see most recently <em>Courrier 2017</em>, <em>Autin 2019</em> pp. 217-486 and <em>Autin 2020</em>). As one of these non-institutional ways the urban masses had to express their opinion, it is logical to find most often in Tacitus <em>rumor vulgi</em> (“rumour of the crowd”, Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 4.29.2, 4.41.1, 15.73.1, <em>Hist.</em> 3.58.8, 4.11.6; similar formulas in Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 3.76.1, 15.48.2 and <em>Hist.</em>, 2.26.5) and never <em>rumor turbae</em> or <em>rumor multitudinis</em>; however, we also read once <em>rumor plebis</em> (Tac., <em>Hist.</em>, 2.91.2) and once <em>rumor populi</em> (Tac., <em>Ann.</em>, 14.29.2). We must therefore accept some variations in this system and leave to Tacitus his fair share of creative liberty when choosing between the different designations of the same urban masses. Nevertheless, this does not mean that <em>vulgus</em> has (at least in Tacitus) a simple “derogatory significance”, as is often accepted since <em>Yavetz 1969</em> (p. 141 for the quotation), and we hope to have conveyed in this paper “a method [...] whereby each and every term [or at least, some of them] may be defined according to legal or sociological [and, one may add, political] principles&quot;, to take a stance opposite to that of the great historian of the Roman plebs (<em>Yavetz 1969</em> p. 142).</p>
