{"goal":"Exploring the representation of women in early modern handwritten news using computational techniques to address randomness and incompleteness in historical archives.","methods":"Combining dynamic system modeling (Random Walks, Markovian simulation), Bayesian inference, and semantic modeling to analyze a collection of Italian manuscript newsletters from the Medici Archive.","process":"Using computational algorithms to identify the presence and themes associated with women in news, applying semantic space modeling to contextualize narratives, and implementing bootstrapping to simulate possible representations in the lost corpus.","results":"Highlighted the limited but recurring presence of women in early modern news, the dominance of elite figures, and patterns of representation tied to movement, social roles, and elite contexts, while addressing archival randomness."}
