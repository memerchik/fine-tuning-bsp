{"goal":"Introducing the paradigm shift towards computational methodologies in Chinese studies and broader humanities disciplines, highlighting their transformative potential for reorienting digital history.","methods":"The article discusses advanced computational tools and interdisciplinary approaches, including Monte Carlo simulations, network analysis, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, and natural language processing. It emphasizes the integration of digital methods with traditional historical analysis to address challenges in data volume, source complexity, and algorithmic biases.","process":"The study involved curating a diverse corpus of historical data, devising computational workflows for processing and analyzing textual and network data, and applying critical perspectives to algorithmic outputs. Experiments included exploring intertextuality in historical novels, visualizing bureaucratic structures, and analyzing the dynamics of public and private spheres in Chinese history.","results":"The article highlights breakthroughs in Chinese digital history, such as mapping intertextuality in literature, uncovering hidden rules of bureaucratic systems, and identifying key figures and dynamics in historical networks. It also underscores the importance of transparency and reproducibility, with datasets and methods made publicly accessible."}
