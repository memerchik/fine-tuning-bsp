{"goal":"Analyzing the discussions within the Delors Committee to explore how economic union topics were addressed during the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) using mixed-methods analysis.","methods":"Combining text mining, topic modeling, network analysis, and close reading of meeting transcripts and tapes to identify discussed topics, participants' contributions, and the extent of attention given to economic union.","process":"Digitizing meeting records, employing natural language processing for entity recognition, conducting network analysis to map interactions, and applying topic modeling to uncover latent themes in the discussions.","results":"Revealed that economic union was the second most discussed topic after monetary policy, but key aspects like banking regulation were underrepresented; demonstrated the value of integrating computational and qualitative methods for historical analysis."}
