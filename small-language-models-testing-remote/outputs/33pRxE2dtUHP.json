{"goal":"Recreating the Kinora motion picture technology using 3D modelling and printing as a heuristic method to explore its historical and technical significance.","methods":"Combining experimental media archaeology, CAD modelling, rapid prototyping, and interdisciplinary collaboration between media historians and engineers to create a functional Kinora replica.","process":"Using an original Kinora viewer and reels as models, developing CAD models, validating designs through finite element analysis, and producing parts using 3D printing and desktop manufacturing techniques in the Engineering 3D Lab.","results":"Produced a functional Kinora replica, providing new insights into its materiality, mechanics, and historical usage while demonstrating the value of interdisciplinary approaches and hands-on experimentation in media archaeology."}
