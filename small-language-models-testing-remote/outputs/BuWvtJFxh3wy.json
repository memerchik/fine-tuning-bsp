{"goal":"Developing the Video Reuse Detector (VRD) toolkit to explore visual similarities in audiovisual archives, enhancing the study of video reuse and cultural memory transformation.","methods":"The VRD integrates machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, with the Faiss library for large-scale similarity searches, alongside tools for dataset preparation and visualization.","process":"The VRD extracts video frames, processes them through EfficientNetB4 CNN to generate visual fingerprints, indexes these fingerprints using Faiss, and applies filtering techniques to refine similarity matches, enabling detailed reuse pattern analysis.","results":"The VRD successfully identified reuse in archival video datasets, enabling researchers to trace cultural narratives, understand audiovisual heritage transformations, and explore large-scale archives effectively while addressing scalability challenges."}
