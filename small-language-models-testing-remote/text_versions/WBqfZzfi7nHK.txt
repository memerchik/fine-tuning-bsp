 digital epigraphy, quantitative research, FAIR science, reproducibility, digital history, Latin inscriptions, epigraphic habit As short texts written on a durable medium, inscriptions offer a window into past societies, their organization, cultural norms, and practices. Several hundred thousand inscriptions in Greek and Latin language survive until today, providing us with a line of evidence concerning populations of large cities and rural communities of the entire Mediterranean Basin in the period between the eighth century BC and eighth century AD. Most published inscriptions have been digitized in online databases. Although open computational tools exist to handle large digital datasets, large-scale and comparative studies of inscriptions are still rare. Numerous technical and conceptual issues, such as the inconsistent resolution of spatial and temporal attributes or the incompatibility of data structures between datasets, hinder the aggregation and analysis of thousands of inscriptions. The incomplete, uncertain, and complex nature of inscriptions as a historical source has compelled us to develop a series of custom open-source tools and reproducible pipelines, enabling a macro-scale overview of epigraphic remains in time and space. Despite the limitations concerning the representativeness of the extant evidence, we still believe that the spatio-temporal patterns we identify in the datasets offer important insights concerning the dynamics of the societies that produced them. To illustrate the potential of quantitative studies in epigraphy, we harvest and render comparable two well-established, yet very distinct, digital collections for Latin epigraphy: Epigraphic Database Heidelberg (EDH) , containing over 81,000 records and Epigraphische Datenbank Clauss-Slaby (EDCS) with over 500,000 records. Placing the datasets side-by-side in a machine readable and comparable format, we contrast past interpretations of epigraphic habit based on limited samples with trends identified in substantially more extensive datasets. We assert that research communities stand to gain from extending digital infrastructures to reduce barriers to access with packages of open and reusable research tools. The main contribution of the article lies in the transparent and accessible application of digital methods that for the first time in the history of the discipline enabled side-by-side explorative analysis of the two largest yet very heterogeneous datasets and provide a starting point for collaborative large-scale research of inscriptions as proxies for past human activity. 1 © Petra Heřmánková - Vojtěch Kaše - Adéla Sobotková.

Close-reading methods dominated early studies of inscriptions, with the aim to reconstruct the text, date and interpret the inscriptions. As the body of evidence grew, synthetic analyses started to emerge to investigate larger-scale patterns ( MacMullen 1982 ; Meyer 1990 ; Woolf 1996 ; Hedrick 1999 ; Nawotka 2020 ). Digitized epigraphic data made it possible to tackle topics such as the evolution of demographic trends, economic development, migration patterns, changes of the socio-political organization and cultural development using distant-reading and other computational techniques ( Wilson 2012 ; Wilson, Flohr 2016 ; de Ligt, Tacoma 2016 ; Hanson, Ortman, Lobo 2017 ; Liuzzo 2019 ). While these computational studies underscore the potential of epigraphic evidence, they rarely use a dataset larger than several thousand records. Greek and Latin inscriptions, however, count hundreds of thousands spanning the Roman Empire spatially and temporally. In this respect, epigraphic datasets can inform large-scale comparative studies of the dynamics of past societies ( Morris 2010 ; Morris 2013 ; Turchin, Scheidel 2009 ; Mullins, Hoyer, Collins, Currie, Feeney, François, Savage, Whitehouse, Turchin 2018 ; Turchin, Currie, Whitehouse, François, Feeney, Mullins, Hoyer, Collins, Grohmann, Savage, Mendel-Gleason, Turner, Dupeyron, Cioni, Reddish, Levine, Jordan, Brandl, Williams, Cesaretti, Krueger, Ceccarelli, Figliulo-Rosswurm, Tuan, Peregrine, Marciniak, Preiser-Kapeller, Kradin, Korotayev, Palmisano, Baker, Bidmead, Bol, Christian, Cook, Covey, Feinman, Júlíusson, Kristinsson, Miksic, Mostern, Petrie, Rudiak-Gould, ter Haar, Wallace, Mair, Xie, Baines, Bridges, Manning, Lockhart, Bogaard, Spencer 2018 ; Ober 2015 ). 10 Currently, such a large-scale study has been beyond the reach of any individual researcher because of the gargantuan efforts of aggregating and streamlining the thousands of inscriptions to make analysis feasible ( Altschul, Kintigh, Klein, Doelle, Hays-Gilpin, Herr, Kohler, Mills, Montgomery, Nelson, Ortman, Parker, Peeples, Sabloff 2018 ; Kintigh, Spielmann, Brin, Candan, Clark, Peeples 2018 ). Even the exact number of ancient inscriptions, dating between 800 BC and 800 AD, currently estimated at 600,000 surviving Latin and Greek ones, remains elusive due to its fragmentation to multiple sources ( Bodel 2001 , 4; Beltrán Lloris 2015 , 135). Although numerous analogue and digital corpora exist, their contents and structure overlap to a variable degree and are not straightforward to combine, providing a major obstacle to comparative studies. While the challenge of technical data wrangling and distant-reading the inscriptions may be beyond a single researcher, a collaborative team equipped with both the necessary computational tools and domain-specific skill set may get further. Working from established digital repositories and building our digital toolkit on the go, we explore the spatiotemporal variation in the distribution of surviving epigraphic monuments and assess the dependency of comparative research on the state of modern-day research infrastructure. 11 Epigraphic habit(s) 40 years later: can we do any better? 12 Inscriptions vary significantly in form and contents, touching almost all aspects of life in an ancient society. Commissioning an inscription was part of a long-term cultural practice that served as a physical response to a change of circumstances, i.e. death, birth, change of legal status, social rank, physical appearance or they can serve as a reminder or reflection of historical events. The inscribed texts range from short private messages on objects of daily use to extensive regulations and codes issued by a political authority, to monumental inscriptions helping to create a public image and build social prestige. In contrast with literary texts, which survived via multiple copying and editing, the text of inscription has the original unaltered form with original typographical and grammatical errors, being an ideal study subject for historical linguists and historians. The information preserved via inscriptions has potentially broader demographic coverage than literary texts, as social groups producing inscriptions were of more diverse socio-economic and cultural background than those of literary texts ( Bodard 2008 ). 13 Similarly to archaeologists who are never sure they have all the pots, epigraphers will never have access to all the inscriptions ever created. Duncan-Jones ( Duncan-Jones 1982 , 360-362) has estimated a rate of preservation for one type of honorific inscription in the cities of Northern Africa at 5 %, but some consider his figure too high and only relevant to the local area ( Noreña 2011 , 181). Should the 5 % survival rate apply and be uniform throughout the Mediterranean, then the 500,000 surviving Latin inscriptions would be a sample of 10 million original inscriptions. Should the rate be 1 %, then we are missing some 50 million inscriptions. These remain guesstimates as the factors influencing the survival of inscriptions, such the availability of durable material, the completeness of archaeological monument surveys, or even the level of plundering or secondary use of inscriptions have not been uniform throughout the Mediterranean ( Mann 1985 , 204-206; Keppie 1991 , 34). The corpus of surviving inscriptions has its biases and is far from a carefully stratified sample. The haphazard process of survival resembles simple random sampling, a method used in quantitative research to lower the margin of error. While a random sample may not be useful for all types of enquiry, it can help us gain accurate insights about the most dominant categories in the epigraphic record. Although we may never be able to estimate the number of all inscriptions ever created, the more than 500,000 of preserved Latin texts represent a dataset too substantial to be omitted or simply dismissed from the debate for being flawed. Thus once we are aware of their biases, inscriptions aggregated into empire-wide collections can serve as a proxy for state power, economic health, building activity, or population trends or as complementary evidence to coin hoards, shipwrecks and other proxies ( Bowman, Wilson 2009 ; Duncan-Jones 1990 ). 14 Working at the level of a province with a couple thousand inscriptions, scholars have started constructing regional diachronic overviews of surviving epigraphic remains and discussing their historical production. Comparative studies between North Africa, Gaul, or Greece revealed that epigraphic evidence from these provinces follows the same diachronic pattern. Inscription numbers peak at the end of the second century AD, during the reign of Septimius Severus (AD 193 - AD 211), and decline abruptly at the beginning of the third century AD ( MacMullen 1982 ; Meyer 1990 ; Woolf 1996 ). Researchers started exploring different drivers for such convergence, from the role of funerary habits to the popularity of public status display to the democratization of citizenship. Elizabeth Meyer, for example, saw the Constitutio Antoniniana in AD 212 as the turning point for epitaph production. Once all inhabitants of the Roman Empire had been granted Roman citizenship, being a Roman citizen lost its prestige and the incentive to commission funerary inscriptions to mark one's status vanished ( Meyer 1990 , 78-81). Such explanations, however, were based on a few regional datasets and of one category of inscriptions and thus limited. Since the time of Meyer or Macmullen, many scholars have attempted to study epigraphic production at the scale of the Roman Empire but found that such efforts were technically entailed (e.g. Hedrick 1999 ; Trout 2009 ; Beltrán Lloris 2015 ; Bolle, Machado, Witschel 2017 ; Nawotka 2020 ; Blanco Pérez 2021 ). First, constraints on interoperability hindered the integration of numerous digital datasets. Second, the volume and diversity of epigraphic data proved challenging to handle and reconcile. Third, analysis was hampered by the inability to quantify the number of inscriptions at any point in time ( Beltrán Lloris 2015 , 139; Elliott 2015 , 80-83; De Santis, Rossi 2018 ). 15 Although the analysis of a large body of digitized texts may seem relatively straightforward from an outsider's point of view, epigraphic datasets pose numerous technological, methodological and even ethical challenges to digital research. What are these constraints, and how do they shift as we move from a thousand inscriptions to several hundred thousand? For large-scale analysis, datasets need to include information on the chronological period and the findspot of each monument in a compatible format to be readily combined. The aggregated datasets should provide representative coverage for a project study area  ( Wilson 2009 , 75). The final aggregate needs to be machine-readable and consistent across columns. The problem with computers is that they do not readily understand 120AD and AD120 and AD 120 to be the same thing. These differences need to be normalized (unified into one canonical form) else the analysis halts, or worse, yields misleading results. When handling a dataset of thousand records, the few variants that occur can be cleaned manually. When handling tens of thousands of records from multiple sources with different formatting, the number of variations becomes so high that it is tractable only with Regular Expressions and other automated validation tools. For spatio-temporal patterns, temporal and spatial attributes often need validation and modelling to account for uncertainty, which is a more entailed process than streamlining the spelling of vocabularies in a list of standardized descriptors. Concepts and meanings need to be mapped and related among datasets to make meaningful analysis possible, either manually or with the application of machine learning ( Kaše, Heřmánková, Sobotkova 2021 ). Computer-assisted analysis (e.g. distant reading) of fragmented texts hinges on the reconciliation of alterations to the Leiden editorial standard, see ( Step 2.3 in Hermeneutics ). Furthermore, researchers need to develop their tools and pipelines to tackle the idiosyncrasies of epigraphic monuments as standard Natural Language Processing pipelines trained on literary data do not work the same way on the texts of inscriptions. 16 When the first digital corpora were established in the 1980’s, they followed the traditional organisation of paper-based corpora from the 19th century, such as Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum (CIG), later transformed into Inscriptiones Graecae (IG) collecting inscriptions in Greek language, or Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) for Latin inscriptions. The initial aim of digital databases was to provide a digital version of the existing publications ( Bruun 2015 , 66-70). The advancement of technology and the development of Linked Open Datasets (LOD), such as Pleiades or Trismegistos has led to the enrichment of the digital datasets, but their mutual compatibility is still hindered by decades-old methodological decisions and different approaches towards data access and dissemination. To demonstrate how to work with datasets on both ends of the spectrum, we take two well-established digital resources and develop a pipeline that allows us and others to combine and reconcile differences between them. The two datasets are products of two distinct projects that share a common idea - to provide a digital version of all surviving and published Latin inscriptions - but implement it differently. Epigraphic Database Clauss-Slaby (EDCS) aims to provide a simple digital record of all Latin inscriptions from the entire Mediterranean and currently contains the most extensive digital collection counting over 500,000 records. Epigraphic Database Heidelberg (EDH) is a flagship resource for Latin epigraphers and a pioneering initiative in the field of open and FAIR epigraphy. EDH aims to provide an exhaustive record for all Latin inscriptions with the exception of Rome, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula ( Elliott 2015 , 80-81). While the EDCS and EDH draw on the same pool of epigraphic evidence, they are independent projects. They differ in the coverage of available data as well as the depth and quality of information provided. 17 Before we tap the potential of inscriptions by combining the exhaustive coverage of EDCS with the thorough records of EDH, however, we need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of this class of evidence. We, therefore, focus on the distribution of preserved inscription data across the Empire, decouple the data from social phenomena it may correlate with and build a foundation for other interpretive studies. We inspect inscription frequencies through time and across space and evaluate the representativeness and suitability of each dataset for different research designs. 18 After the initial - primarily technical - obstacles of wrangling a large quantity of epigraphic evidence into a compatible machine-readable format, conceptual obstacles emerge. The most common obstacle, which affects most historical and archaeological data, yet the hardest one to tackle, is the paucity of high-resolution dates and the need to inventively work with chronological assignment. 19 Following the open science practices ( Lowndes, Best, Scarborough, Afflerbach, Frazier, O’Hara, Jiang, Halpern 2017 ), we use reproducible programmatic methods throughout the data aggregation and analysis. Each step in the data collection and streamlining is transparent and documented. All project stages are accessible via public repositories on the Social Dynamics in the Ancient Mediterranean Project (SDAM) GitHub and Zenodo under CC-BY-SA 4.0 International license EDH dataset , EDCS dataset . 20 Data sources 21 We have chosen two well-established digital sources for Latin inscriptions, Epigraphic Database Heidelberg and Epigraphic Database Clauss-Slaby , in order to demonstrate the range of challenges a digital historian has to face when doing comparative historical research, starting from the incompatibility of digital resources, through the technical issues of wrangling several hundred thousands of data points, to the imperfect state of the historical datasets. Although both projects collect Latin epigraphic data and publish them on the web, they implement different approaches to data structures, encoding, sharing and reuse. The following section describes these differences, especially in encoding of the spatial and chronological attributes and transcriptions of the epigraphic text, that most impact our quantitative analysis. 22 Epigraphic Database Heidelberg The Epigraphic Database Heidelberg ( EDH ) represents the flagship digital resource for the discipline of digital epigraphy with over 35 years of development and meticulously curated content ( Hartmann 2018 ). EDH was established by Prof. Géza Alföldy in 1986 and funded by the Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz-Preis (DFG), which in 2013-2021 was taken over by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. In the 1990’s EDH became part of the newly formed an Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy (EAGLE), consortium aiming to create a digital record for all surviving inscriptions ( Elliott 2015 , 81). The EDH was to collect all inscriptions from the Roman Empire with the exception of inscriptions already recorded by the EAGLE partners, i.e. the Epigraphic Database Roma collecting pre-Christian inscriptions from Rome and Italy, Epigraphic Database Bari collecting Christian inscriptions from Rome and Italy, and Hispania Epigraphica collecting inscriptions from the Iberian Peninsula ( Orlandi 2021 , 4-5). The EDH dataset in 2021 counted over 81,000 inscriptions dating from the sixth century BC to the ninth century AD and covering most of the area of the former Roman Empire. 23 Accessing EDH EDH is one of the pioneers of digital and open epigraphy, providing high standard and accessible digital resources. The original aim of the project financed by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities is “to render the epigraphic documentation of the provinces of the Roman Empire as completely and reliably as possible for online research work”. Following the FAIR data principles, the entire EDH Open Data Repository can be reused under the CC BY-SA 4.0 licence making it an ideal candidate for quantitative research on epigraphic trends in the Roman Empire. The entire dataset is accessible programmatically via a public API ( Application Programming Interface ; Grieshaber 2019 ). Alternatively, researchers can access the data in raw EpiDoc format, an XML/TEI standard created by the team around Tom Elliott and Hugh Cayless ( Elliott, Bodard, Mylonas, Stoyanova, Tupman, Vanderbilt 2020 ). The data is also available via Zenodo and GitHub archive. However, only the API contains the most updated version of the data and will do so until the end of 2021. The phase of active data entry will finish in December 2021, when the project’s funding will cease ( Feraudi-Gruénais, Grieshaber 2016 ). The accessibility of the dataset after 2022 ensures the release of the data archives through Zenodo and GitHub . 24 The EDH API provides direct access to the latest data, consisting of 11 attributes providing spatial and temporal information, information about the inscribed object, the text of an inscription, its typological categorization, bibliographical references and links to related digital sources and photos. Geospatial data is stored separately in the Geo API and all the individual EpiDoc XML/TEI files with raw data. In June 2019, the authors claimed the database contained over 1.4 million metadata fields in total, averaging 18 attributes per inscription ( Grieshaber 2019 , 3). As of September 2020, the EDH contained over 81,476 inscriptions, almost 40,000 photographs, 30,000+ locations and over 16,000 bibliographical publications. 25 EDH uses the standardized vocabularies created between 2013-2015 by the EAGLE Europeana Project and adopted by the EpiDoc TEI/XML based community of digital epigraphers to denote a type of an inscription, inscribed object, material, presence or absence of decoration. One attribute in EDH can contain only one record, i.e. predominant type of an inscription or one type of material, however the associated description contains unconstrained text both in German and English. 26 We extracted data from EDH on 22 September 2020 via the APIs, and the EpiDoc XML/TEI dumps linked on the project’s website and created a dataset for the purpose of quantitative study. After initial streamlining and cleaning, our dataset contains 81,476 records, each subdivided into 74 attributes containing combined textual and geospatial information and the text of an inscription. We discuss the entire process of access and transformation of the dataset and our custom technological solutions in detail in the Hermeneutics section . 27 Spatial information in EDH The inscriptions in the EDH come from 54 modern countries, corresponding to 65 Roman provinces (extant in mid-second century AD), covering the entire Roman Empire and neighbouring regions. As per EDH website , not all the provinces in EDH have the same state of data entry: in some provinces, all known and published inscriptions were entered, such as Italic provinces, while in others the records contain only provisional and incomplete information and need to be finalized, e.g. provinces in Asia or Africa. When considering the spatial distribution and representativeness of EDH data, it is worth noting that EDH primarily focuses on collecting data from the provinces and it heavily subsamples inscriptions from the city of Rome. This is because there are numerous other databases whose single focus is on the epigraphic remains from Rome, such as Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR) , or Epigraphic Database Bari (EDB) that focuses on Christian inscriptions of Rome subsequently EDCS that draws data from EDR. According to the EDR website, there are more than 34,000 inscriptions from Rome itself, but EDH contains only 4393 inscriptions labelled as from the province Rome . 28 To evaluate the spatial distribution of inscriptions across the Roman Empire, we need each record to have machine-readable spatial information. EDH contains spatial information in both textual and true geospatial format (Latitude, Longitude). Textual data have been digitized from the printed account of a findspot in the original publication, editio princeps . After digitization, the spatial information was organized and subdivided into one or more attribute fields, such as “name of ancient settlement”, “Roman province”, “modern country”, “region of modern place name”, or alternatively “place of the present location” of the inscription. When feasible, geospatial coordinates were generated from these attributes and stored in the coordinates attribute. Where possible, the locations are linked to established LOD spatial gazetteers, such as Trismegistos or Pleiades for ancient places, or Geonames for modern places. The spatial information level is highly variable in the database, as it depends on individual object history, circumstances of discovery, and the contemporary method of documenting spatial uncertainties and the accuracy of provided locations should be taken with a grain-of-salt. 29 However the provinces may seem to historians as the best spatial unit to analyse distribution of inscriptions, potentially circumventing the problem of accuracy, we should be aware of their fixed assignment by authors of EDH. While the province boundaries in EDH do not change with time and remain in the form from mid-second century AD (with the exception of Moesia Inferior), some inscriptions found in the same place may have in fact be created under a different provincial affiliation, but authors of EDH do not reflect such variation and use stable province labels for inscriptions with different chronology. 30 If we drill down to the textual attribute providing the most details of the place where an inscription was found, the attribute findspot_ancient is recorded in 83.5 % of EHD records. However, the attribute findspot_ancient in its raw form contains 3613 unique text strings, including notations of uncertainty ("?") or textual indicators of spatial fuzziness, such as "nearby” (bei), "in the vicinity of" (aus), "in between" (inter, zwischen), for details see the Hermeneutic section, Step 2.2 . By extracting the textual indicators of uncertainty during the cleaning process, we narrowed down the total number of unique ancient findspots to 2342. While the name of an ancient findspot is useful for contextual socio-historical studies, the textual format is unsuitable for spatial analysis. 31 In contrast with the findspot_ancient attribute and the other text-based attributes, the coordinates column in EDH is consistently formatted and can be used with minimal wrangling. It contains a pair of decimal coordinates representing a discrete location on the surface of the Earth, separated by a comma, which can be readily mapped by computer. In the EDH, 97 % of records (79,012) contain valid coordinates while only 3 % of records (2,464 inscriptions) lack geospatial coordinates. We use geospatial coordinates in the format as-is, thus inheriting all biases and errors present in EDH. 32 Chronological information in EDH Chronological information is in the EDH database distributed across six attributes, either as textual or numeric values representing the most probable date of an inscription. The date is stored as an interval between the two points in time, represented by the attributes not_before and not_after . For computational reasons and ease of use, all the dates in EDH have been transformed by EDH authors into four digits numerals, representing a year, e.g. -0143 stands for 143 BC, 0036 stands for AD 36. The numerical form enables one to access the dates computationally and, first of all, to study the chronological trends in surviving epigraphic corpora over time. 33 The not_before attribute represents the earliest possible year when the inscription was created and is available for 59,788 (73.38 % of all) inscriptions in the EDH, ranging from 530 BC to AD 901 (excluding the dates from 19th and 20th century AD). The not_after attribute stands for the latest possible year when the inscription was created and is available for 56,281 (69.08 % of all) inscriptions, covering the time range from 503 BC to 950 AD, excluding the 16th to 20th-century outliers. The total of 56,281 inscriptions (69.08 % of all) contains both numeric attributes, with the average length of the interval between the two dates 120.5 years. 34 For most of the inscriptions, the database does not provide any additional information on how precise the date is or which dating method was used to determine the exact date. The original EpiDoc XML/TEI files provide a reference to a dating system used, such as the Julian calendar, but any other details are not provided. The attribute commentary provides chronological information only sporadically, and if so, then only as unconstrained text that is computationally difficult to standardize. Thus, we trust the editors of the original volumes and the responsible personnel from the EDH team and use the data in the form provided. 35 Textual information in EDH The text of an inscription is available to 81,473 records, representing 99,99 % of the entire dataset. The text contained many symbols and editorial marks preventing any meaningful computational analysis of the text. We have created a cleaning pipeline with several different variants offering different levels of “cleanliness” from faithful to inscription to clean analysis-ready text while maintaining the text's integrity; for details, see the Hermeneutics section, Step 2 . After the cleaning, the text of all inscriptions in EDH contains between 1.14 and 1.22 million words, depending on the method of counting (base R vs stringr package in R). 36 Language of inscriptions in EDH The vast majority of the 81,476 inscriptions recorded in the EDH database are written in Latin (97.57 % of all inscriptions). Greek inscriptions represent 1.58 %, combined Greek-Latin inscriptions of 0.81 %, and other Mediterranean languages such as Phoenician, Punic, Celtic, Hebrew, Iberian, Italic, Numidian, or Palmyrenic and their combination with mostly Latin. Therefore, the EDH dataset predominantly represents epigraphic cultures publishing in Latin rather than all epigraphic languages of the Mediterranean. Due to its geographic focus on Roman provinces, the EDH dataset does not provide a representative sample for Greek-writing cultures of the Roman East, although it contains some Latin inscriptions from the Eastern Mediterranean. 37 Epigraphik Datenbank Clauss-Slaby The Epigraphik Datenbank Clauss-Slaby ( EDCS ) represents the most extensive digital resource for Latin epigraphy up-to-date. It contains over 500,000 inscriptions previously published in print or other digital sources, covering the surviving Latin inscriptions around the entire Mediterranean from the seventh century BC to the 10th century AD. While aware of its limitations, we have specifically chosen the EDCS for its unparalleled spatial and temporal coverage. 38 Accessing EDCS The original project of Prof. Manfred Clauss and Dr Wolfgang A. Slaby dates back to 1980, and its main goal was to create one digital source for all Latin inscriptions. The project, currently hosted by the Catholic University Eichstätt-Ingolstadt, is constantly being developed, and new inscriptions are being added to the database in 2021 and published in the EDCS Journal . On 12 Dec 2020, the EDCS website stated the database contained 817,455 sets of data, of which 521,696 are inscriptions, 22,232 places and 184,323 datings, combining data from 37 other digital sources . However, compared to EDH, the metadata in EDCS are reduced to the most basic information such as date or location, prioritizing search function over critical edition ( Hartmann 2018 ). 39 The license is not as eloquently specified as in the case of EDH, making the data "subject to copyright and other laws for the protection of intellectual property" . The access to the database is via a web interface in English, German, Spanish, French and Italian translations, allowing users to search for predefined attributes, such as province, place, material, date and of course, the text of the inscription. The search results can be only visualised on the website or copied manually one by one. Moreover, if one wants to quote the results of their search, the website does not provide unique identifiers nor preserve the search results in any format. Thus, the web interface is not intended for quantitative research, yet it currently represents the only public access point to the data. 40 The shortcomings and inconsistencies, most likely caused by the unprecedented size, provide a source of frustration within the epigraphic community ( Cooley, Mitchell, Salway 2007 , 179; Beltrán Lloris 2015 , 136; Elliott 2015 , 80-81; Lotz 2020 ; Orlandi 2021 ). Any comparative study based on the irreproducible output of the web search interface may potentially provide misleading results, without being able to verify them. To provide an example of problematic output, when searched for all inscriptions coming from province Roma (search term province = Roma ), the web search interface states there were 121,165 inscriptions. However, when counting the unique EDCS ID of the output, we have noticed a discrepancy of 30,364 records. The difference in output might be caused by the rendering limitations of the website or the fact the calculation algorithm displaying the total number of inscriptions found on the EDCS web search interface draws data from a different source. However, we have noticed this particular issue only in the case of province Roma. In the case of other provinces, the number of unique IDs was corresponding with the calculated total number of inscriptions found . 41 The EDCS web search interface contains 16 attributes providing spatial and temporal information, information about the inscribed object, as well as the text of an inscription, its typological categorisation, bibliographical references and links to related digital sources and photos where available. We accessed the dataset on 9 December 2020 when the web interface contained 500,536 inscriptions in total. We will discuss the details of the access & transformation process in the Hermeneutics section, Step 1.2 . 42 EDCS does not use standard typologies, as introduced by the EAGLE Europeana Project and applied in EDH. Instead, the categorisation of inscriptions was published on the website in 2017 as inscription genus without further documentation explaining the editorial decision behind each category. The EDCS website states there are 20 categories of titulorum distributio , but some of them are linked to the execution or inscribing process rather than to the typology and social function of inscriptions. While EDH provides one type per inscription, a single inscription in EDCS can have multiple labels. Although the EDCS approach is more fitting to the multifaceted functionality of inscriptions in the ancient world, it lacks detailed definitions of the meaning of individual labels and thus limits potential mapping and linking to other digital sources. We have tried to solve the issue of inconsistent typologies by application of machine learning, summarising the results in ( Kaše, Heřmánková, Sobotkova 2021 ). 43 EDCS also contains some of the inscriptions already recorded in EDH. When we compare both sources, EDCS contains about 91 % (74,313 records) of the inscriptions available in EDH, but with fewer attributes than in EDH. We have created a filtered version of the EDCS dataset without the duplicated records from EDH and named it EDCSx (n= 426,314 inscriptions), so that we can compare the trends in epigraphic remains across both sources. We only removed records that eloquently pointed to EDH as their source, but it is highly likely that some inscriptions in EDCSx may still overlap and exist in both sources (but not exceeding 7,163 records). 44 Spatial information in EDCS Similarly, as in the case of the EDH dataset, EDCS provides spatial information specifying the findspot of an inscription as text-based attributes and as geospatial coordinates. The textual description of the findspot can be broken into several categories, such as the name of an ancient settlement and a Roman province. In comparison with EDH, the EDCS dataset provides fewer textual attributes that are often structured differently, making a comparison between the two datasets difficult. EDCS provides textual information describing the findspot for 98 % of records, combining ancient and modern place names into one attribute with varying separators, while EDH breaks down the information into several attributes. 45 Inscriptions from EDCS come from 62 Roman provinces, covering the area of the Roman Empire and neighbouring areas as visualised on the EDCS website . Unlike EDH, province labels are not pegged to a specific period and the assignment and labeling conventions are undocumented. EDCS and EDH use different regional typologies and province labels making province-based comparisons difficult. Both terminologies have to be manually mapped onto each other or reconstructed on the basis of geospatial coordinates. Any comparison between EDH and EDCS based on the textual descriptors of location thus becomes computationally complex. EDCS, however, contains Latitude and Longitude, most likely extracted from the original data source, such as EDH (74,304) or EDR (87,518 records), or from spatial gazetteers such as Trismegistos (1,146 records). The provenance of coordinates is not provided for 251,050 inscriptions (50 %), and thus the method of creation of coordinates and their precision lies directly with the authors of EDCS. In total, 486,697 inscriptions representing 97.2 % of the entire EDCS dataset contain attributes Latitude and Longitude in a numeric, and thus computationally accessible, form. 46 Chronological information in EDCS Chronological information in the EDCS dataset is distributed across three attributes, either as textual description or a numeric value presented as a text string. The EDCS does not provide any additional information on how precise the date is or which dating method was used for most of the texts. In some cases, more than one dating is available, and a variant dating is placed into the same attribute and needs to be computationally separated. 47 The attributes dating_to and dating_from represent an interval between the two years when the inscription was created. In 121 cases, the dating to attribute contains an alternative dating within the same attribute (as an unconstrained text, with values separated by semicolon). The dating_from attribute is available for 163,497, representing 32.7 % of all inscriptions, with most inscriptions being dated between 700 BC to 901 AD. The dating_to attribute provides dates for 164,458 inscriptions which corresponds with 32.8 % of the dataset, with the majority of inscriptions dated between 671 BC to 950 AD. Both temporal attributes are present in 163,380 inscriptions (32.6 % of the entire dataset). The average value for the length of the dating interval between dating from and dating to is 92.25 years, which is approximately 30 years lower than in EDH. While the overall ratio of dated inscriptions in EDCS is substantially lower than in the case of EDH, it still provides more than twice as many data points for temporal study. 48 To better contrast the differences in temporal trends in EDH and EDCS, for some of our analyses we decided to use the deduplicated EDCSx dataset, with the records overlapping in EDH removed. The EDCSx dataset contains 106,382 dated inscriptions with both start and end date. 49 Textual information in EDCS Text of an inscription is available for 479,546 inscriptions, representing 95.8 % of the EDCS dataset. The records without text of an inscription were written in languages other than Latin (4.2 %). The text of an inscription contains a large number of characters, special symbols, or comments and notes that prevent application of quantitative text analysis. We had to computationally streamline the text, before proceeding further. The details of the entire process are described in the Hermeneutics section, Step 1 . The text of all inscriptions in EDCS after cleaning contains between 4.6 and 4.06 million words, depending on the applied counting function (base R vs stringr package in R). 50 Language of inscriptions in EDCS EDCS focuses primarily on Latin inscriptions, while inscriptions in other languages are recorded unsystematically. The language of the inscription is not recorded as a separate attribute, but rather it is inserted into the text of the inscription as an abbreviation in double-quotes, e.g. GR , ETR , PUN etc. The Latin language is not recorded with the assumption that all inscriptions are Latin unless stated otherwise. In order to count the total number of Latin inscriptions, one has to transform all notations of other languages into a new attribute and count only the records where the language attribute is empty. There is a risk of potentially counting also inscriptions with unknown or not recorded language, but the structure of EDCS does not provide any means to distinguish between truly empty records or records that are written in Latin. The records with an empty language attribute form 95.39 % of the entire corpus, approximately representing the ratio of Latin inscriptions in EDCS. 51 The second most numerous group in EDCS are inscriptions that contain at least one word in Greek, representing 4.38 % of the entire corpus (21,933 inscriptions) including multilingual texts. The text of the Greek inscriptions is, however, missing, even in the case of bilingual inscriptions ( Hartmann 2018 ). From other language groups, EDCS contains data for inscriptions in Iberian, Etruscan, Punic, Hebraic, Oscan and at least a dozen other languages, but they seem to be recorded rather episodically (less than 0.3 % in total) and without the text of an inscription as well. The contents of EDCS reflect epigraphic traditions of the Latin-writing world throughout the Mediterranean even more strictly than EDH. Such records may serve only as a reminder that some communities were bi- or trilingual, but should not be used to study epigraphic multilingualism or the preferences of publication language. 52 FAIRness and utility of EDH and EDCS Like in many other disciplines there is no single database or federated data source suitable for quantitative analysis of Latin inscriptions. Different datastores co-exist governed by different design principles serving different initial aims. While the EDCS with its 500,000 inscriptions provides the most complete digital collection of Latin inscriptions, it was not designed with quantitative computational research in mind. Anyone wishing to reuse the collection in its entirety first needs to scrape each record from the EDCS in HTML. The limited EDCS documentation on methodological decisions behind the design of the database, most palpable in the multivalued classifications of inscriptions, which need to be streamlined before analysis, pose serious problems for computer-assisted analysis. EDH with its 81,000+ records occupies the other side of the spectrum, having been designed with eye to quantitative methods but lacking the wide coverage of the EDCS. Although EDCS wins in the absolute number of records, EDH greatly exceeds EDCS in the consistent quality and internal organisation of spatial and temporal attributes, information about the inscribed object, modern interpretations and typological classifications, and most importantly the format of the inscription text. The EDH website documents the data structure and clarifies methodological decisions made during data encoding. Reuse options are specified and links to other open datasets of the Ancient Mediterranean are provided, making EDH the go-to epigraphic dataset for quantitative research. While EDCS might seem better due to the bigger data it contains, EDH is the "right" data sensu ( Borgman 2015 ) in this case. 53 Preparing historical sources for quantitative research 54 Each researcher who aggregates historical data will sooner or later confront the problem of inconsistent format, variable provenance and precision of spatial and temporal information ( Altschul, Kintigh, Klein, Doelle, Hays-Gilpin, Herr, Kohler, Mills, Montgomery, Nelson, Ortman, Parker, Peeples, Sabloff 2018 ; Kintigh, Spielmann, Brin, Candan, Clark, Peeples 2018 ). The extent of problems such as missing data, spatial error, or wide temporal intervals needs to be evaluated and mitigated as a researcher starts to interrogate the data. Idiosyncratic data formats can constrain possible analyses or have a serious impact on the outcome of quantitative analysis. Data provenance, representativeness and distribution uniformity over sampled areas will affect the robustness of interpretations. 55 For a more structured overview, we can unpack the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) acronym from the FAIR data principles and test it against the datasets ( Wilkinson, Dumontier, Aalbersberg, Appleton, Axton, Baak, Blomberg, Boiten, da Silva Santos, Bourne, Bouwman, Brookes, Clark, Crosas, Dillo, Dumon, Edmunds, Evelo, Finkers, Gonzalez-Beltran, Gray, Groth, Goble, Grethe, Heringa, ’t Hoen, Hooft, Kuhn, Kok, Kok, Lusher, Martone, Mons, Packer, Persson, Rocca-Serra, Roos, van Schaik, Sansone, Schultes, Sengstag, Slater, Strawn, Swertz, Thompson, van der Lei, van Mulligen, Velterop, Waagmeester, Wittenburg, Wolstencroft, Zhao, Mons 2016 ). Both EDH and EDCS fulfil the “F" component by being findable online, but only EDH fully ticks "AIR", being accessible via API or bulk EpiDoc XML/TEI downloads, linking data with other LOD resources, providing metadata and enabling data-reuse under Creative Commons license. EDCS data are published and accessible for free for searching, but any quantitative research requires a third-party tool to extract data in a reusable format ( Wilson 2009 ; Lotz 2020 ). The next step, interoperability, gets progressively harder to achieve. Defined as "the ability of data or tools from non-cooperating resources to integrate or work together with minimal effort" , this state was accomplished in circa six months of work (after a long exploratory stage of scoping and testing different approaches) and required a pipeline through which technical and domain specialists could exchange data back and forth. Once the pipeline existed, we cleaned attributes sufficiently to reconcile and integrate fields relevant for analysis. This cleaning and consultation of attributes facilitated the final stage of reuse, where the resulting datasets were modelled in time and plotted on a map to facilitate comparative analysis. Before actual reuse, however, researchers need to overcome one final barrier. 56 Spatial precision and sources of error Both EDH and EDCS datasets provide spatial information on the findspot in the form of angular coordinates formatted as decimal numbers for 97 % of all records. The coordinates are based on the WGS 1984 model of Earth and vary in spatial precision depending on the number of decimals they contain. Some coordinates are specified with zero decimal places, while others can have up to seven decimal places (e.g. 42 or 42.3681563). With each additional decimal place, the spatial precision of the findspot improves. One degree of longitude covers a distance of circa 111 km, depending on roughly where on Earth one is (parallels are longer close to the equator and shorter close to the poles while still running a full circle of 360 degrees). With each additional decimal, the precision of the location increases tenfold, reaching the radius of 1cm precision in seven decimals. When we compare the precision of coordinates between EDH and EDCS, nearly 80 % of EDH records have coordinates with four or fewer decimal digits, while 80 % of EDCS records show coordinates with a minimum of seven decimal places. In sum, 97 % of the EDCS geometries have at least four decimal places in both coordinates. 57 At face value, EDCS should thus provide more accurate spatial data. Decimal numbers, however, are not the only quality indicator. Textual attributes specifying the original findspot are another indicator, and these are more scarce in EDCS. EDH records may only provide coordinates with precision at the level of metres instead of centimetres, but because they also feature more detailed and structured descriptions of the original findspot, the spatial data seem more robust and reliable. Furthermore, the rigorous review process of EDH, where each record is assigned a responsible editor before publishing, inspires more confidence in data quality. While nearly all present-day coordinates in EDH are derived from major Open Source projects such as Pleiades, Trismegistos or from an internal EDH database of Places ( EDH GeoApi , only approximately 50 % of all records in EDCS is linked to an external spatial gazetteer or other digital resources. Since EDCS does not provide documentation on how the exact location for the remaining 250,000 inscriptions has been established, we can only guess that they were most likely harvested in bulk rather than created or checked manually one by one, which leaves more space for inaccuracies. 58 The gathering of absolute coordinates on a large scale only became possible in the last 20 years with the easy availability of consumer-grade GPS. Only 6.9 % of inscriptions in EDH were found after 1980 and 4.3 % after 1990. Most epigraphic corpora, however, define the location of inscriptions as relative to other contemporary places, often topographic or manmade features that may no longer exist today. Such descriptions of relative location had to first be digitised and then georeferenced, i.e. converted to spatial format (Latitude and Longitude) and anchored to some digital spatial model of the world. This was done on the basis of information given by the author of the editio princeps . Creators' spatial skills also played a role in the choice of model and tools, whether manual clicking in desktop GIS software or GoogleMaps and similar web tools or semi-automatically using geocoding. 59 To circumvent the need to create spatial data, coordinates for well-known ancient sites can often be extracted from the Linked Open Datasets (LOD), such as Trismegistos or Pleiades . These derived single point coordinates, however, were at some point also created by hand and suffer from the same problems as mentioned above. Each point has its own history and is subject to multiple authors and editors. The uncertainty is compounded if coordinates are assigned in bulk via the extraction from LOD databases, where the algorithm assigns the coordinates of the nearest ancient place rather than the exact location specified in the textual description of the findspot. To illustrate the problem with an example, inscription EDH HD005489 was found between ancient cities Thamugadi and Lambaesis that are 20 km distant as-crow-flies, but the coordinates extracted from Trismegistos Places point to the location of Thamugadi instead of a location 10 km west of the city. This is most likely the result of the computer algorithm not being able to interpret the findspot with higher precision than the nearest known ancient or modern site. 60 Given that services such as Pleiades or Trismegistos refer to larger spatial entities, such as cities or building complexes, coordinates with more than four decimal places convey false precision. The centimetre-level precision can mislead the reader into thinking that the exact location, such as the excavation context of an inscription, is known and was documented with a total station or similar high-precision method. The findspot of an inscription, as represented by the Pleiades or other coordinates, is in most cases much less precise, with the margin of error in the range of several hundreds of metres or few kilometres. 61 Unfortunately, digital sources only rarely provide further information on the provenance of geospatial data in a structured form accessible to a computer. Until such information on whether the inscription was found in situ or in its secondary context, transferred to a church or built into a wall is made available in digital corpora, along with the method of their creation, the coordinates, even with their known biases and limitations represent the best geospatial data at hand. 62 Reconciling heterogenous date ranges in inscriptions Before anyone can ponder the motivations behind commissioning an inscription in a particular place and time, we need to be able to locate inscriptions in space and, most importantly, in time. While the spatial aspect has been satisfactorily solved with the use of spatial gazetteers and Linked Open Datasets (LOD), the temporal classification of inscriptions contains a large degree of uncertainty and fuzziness, making any comparative study dependent on computational solutions ( Rabinowitz, Shaw, Golden 2018 , 203-204). 63 The epigraphic date represents a modern editorial interpretation of the most probable yet tentative point in time when the inscription was created. The date is determined by the editor based on the available evidence extracted from the inscription itself and contextual links to already existing chronological systems. If the text of an inscription contains a reference to a known calendar system, historical event or person, editors can assign an absolute date, often with the precision of one or several years. In most cases, however, the editor is able to place inscriptions within a relative chronological system on the basis of its textual content, physical medium, form and iconography, style of the lettering, or, where available, archaeological context ( Bodel 2001 , 49-52; McLean 2003 , 149-176; Rabinowitz, Shaw, Golden 2018 , 204-205). The relative date is usually less precise than the absolute one as its duration can span over several centuries or periods, such as the Hellenistic, Early Roman period etc. Taking into account the level of uncertainty when determining the exact date of creation, most of the digital epigraphic sources use a numeric representation of an interval between two points of time, the so-called terminus post quem and terminus ante quem , delimiting the period of time with the highest likelihood of inscription being created. For example, with the date 212 BC - 150 BC, the editor asserts the inscription was created at one point of time in those 62 years, but given the lack of other evidence, they are unable to narrow that interval down to a single year. 64 While it is reasonable to plot inscriptions dated to individual years on a temporal axis, the same method cannot be applied to inscriptions with a wide dating interval in order to produce meaningful outputs. Traditionally the chronological comparisons were done by grouping inscriptions by centuries, or 20 or 25-year-long time blocks and counting their total numbers ( MacMullen 1982 ; Meyer 1990 ; Nawotka 2020 , 9). In order to assign an inscription to a predefined time block, such as century, the most common method was to calculate an average value (mean) of the temporal interval. The issue is especially problematic with inscriptions dated on a century basis that represents the most common dating interval (21 % in EDH and 24 % of all dated inscriptions in EDCS). For instance, all inscriptions dated to the second century AD, i.e. dated to the interval from AD 101 to AD 200, are then approached as dated to the year 150 AD. Once there are many inscriptions dated on a century basis, an artificial spike emerges around the mid-century, suggesting there was a higher likelihood of inscriptions being produced in the midsections of the century. Year AD 150, however, in most cases does not correspond with the level of uncertainty the editor of the inscription intended to provide. Should the editor be certain the inscription was created in AD 150, they would have communicated the fact in the first place. Instead, they choose an interval suggesting the inscription was created in any of the 99 years, not towards its middle. To deal with the inflation of dates in mid-intervals, researchers often discarded the inscriptions where the temporal interval was too broad. This method, however led to the loss of a large portion of dated inscriptions, which represents another limiting factor for temporal analysis ( Prag 2002 ; Prag 2013 ; Korhonen 2011 ; Nawotka 2020 , 22-23; Janouchová (Heřmánková) 2021 ) 65 The ability to gauge margins of error and to work with temporal uncertainty is one of the biggest challenges to synthesizing projects that wish to retain as much data as possible for large-scale diachronic analyses. Aoristic sum offers one approach to balance the highly variable temporal resolution of individual inscriptions and to visualize long-term trends. In this method, each inscription gets assigned a probability based on the duration of the date interval within each time block, for example, for each century or for 50-year-long time blocks. The probability weights of all inscriptions are then summed up in the predefined time blocks and plotted on a temporal axis. The aoristic sum method is useful to compare the level of change from one period to another and has been used in archaeology and related disciplines ( Johnson 2004 ; Crema 2012 ; Verhagen, Vossen, Groenhuijzen, Joyce 2016 ; Oksanen, Lewis 2020 ). The method is appropriate as far as we are concerned about changes in the total number of inscriptions from one time block to another. However, it proves to be insufficient when we want to combine the temporal analysis with other types of analyses. 66 To overcome the limitations of the aoristic sum method, we have adopted a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approach inspired by recent applications in archaeology ( Crema 2012 ; Crema, Kobayashi 2020 ). For that purpose, we developed a custom TEMPUN Python package ( Kaše 2021 , TEMPUN package ). The MCS approach allowed us to analyse temporal trends in the data in combination with other types of analysis, for example, the spatial distribution of inscriptions in different time periods. Following this approach, we first assigned to each dated inscription 1,000 random dates within its temporal interval. The dates were created randomly but following a uniform distribution, i.e. all years from within the temporal interval were represented with the same level of probability. We have decided to use a uniform probabilistic distribution, assuming the likelihood of inscription being created in the beginning, in the middle, or towards the end of the temporal interval was constant. For an inscription dated in the period between 212 BC and 150 BC, for example, the probability of being created in 202 BC, 199 BC, 175 BC, or 150 BC is the same and does not change with time. We have then recombined the random dates into 1,000 time series, each of which contains all inscriptions dated to one singular year within their creation interval. This format of the data subsequently allows us to analyze the distribution of each time series and to plot these distributions together by means of a cumulative line histogram. In our applications, the bin positions on the x axis represent 25-year-long time blocks, while the variation along the y axis expresses the extent of temporal uncertainty associated with that time block. The width of the resulting line reflects the spread of all the 1000 simulated counts for a given time block, with the upper limit representing a maximal count of inscriptions for a given time block, the lower limit being a minimum count. Grey color is used for plotting values out of the 95% confidence interval. 67 In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the MCS method and the Tempun package, we plot and inspect the epigraphic data from EDH and EDCS side-by-side and investigate major changes in the function and use of inscriptions in the Roman Empire over time. 68 Quantifying the epigraphic habit , in space and time 69 Now that we are able to quantify the number of inscriptions per arbitrary period of time, what new insights do our datasets bring to the topic of epigraphic production? Does differential digitisation of provincial epigraphic datasets impact the results visibly? Starting with dataset-wide explorations, we move down to more focused and thematic level, searching for the most useful scale to evaluate both the relevance of datasets, but also to assess the relative trends in distribution of Latin inscriptions across the Roman Empire. 72 To facilitate comparison and remain mindful of data origin, we display the results from all three datasets side-by-side. The datasets include dated inscriptions from the EDH (n=59,788), the EDCS (n=164,452) and the filtered EDCSx dataset (n=106,382) devoid of detectable duplicates with EDH. By subjecting all sources to the same temporal simulation method, we render the data comparable and can now evaluate the pattern and relative change in epigraphic remains across sources as well as per individual provinces or type of inscription. 73 Figure 1 demonstrates that the temporal trend of quantified inscriptions differs between the EHD, EHCS, and EDCSx datasets. The light grey boundary shows time series that fall outside of the 95 % confidence interval, while the color itself (blue, red, or green) represents results for time series within the 95 % confidence interval. The thickness of each line indicates the amount of temporal uncertainty in a given time interval, wider lines suggesting more and narrower lines less uncertainty. The thickness of the color lines on Figure 1 (surrounded by relatively narrow areas styled in light grey colour) signals that a dataset-wide level comparison contains a relatively low level of temporal uncertainty. It also shows that the impact of temporal uncertainty is inversely proportional to the number of data points in the plotted time series (cf. Figure 4 ). The EDH dataset follows the trend identified by Woolf and McMullen with a peak around AD 200, while the EDCS peaks at the turn of the millennium and persists until the beginning of the third century when it declines. EDCSx, representing EDCS without records duplicated in EDH, shows the peak of epigraphic activity in the first century AD, followed by gradual, yet continuous decline. 90 The dated inscriptions in the EDH dataset (n=59,788) styled in blue show a steady growth in the number of inscriptions from the beginning of the Roman Imperial Period (27 BC) up to the AD 200, with a maximum number of inscriptions reaching 6,000 per 25 years. The peak in AD 200 is followed by a century of steady decline and from AD 300 the numbers of preserved inscriptions in EDH are very low until AD 600. 91 The dated inscriptions in the complete EDCS dataset (n=164,452) in green color slowly rise during the first century BC, followed by a steep increase in the number of inscriptions around the beginning of the Roman Imperial Period (27 BC), yielding an average between 10,000 and 12,000 inscriptions per 25 years. The number of surviving inscriptions remained high and relatively stable until AD 212 when the numbers dropped sharply by a half in the second half of the third century AD. During the fourth century AD, the number of inscriptions fluctuated between 5,000-6,000 inscriptions per 25 years, followed by a drop to approximately 2,000 inscriptions per 25 years in the following century. Another drop came around AD 500, after which the epigraphic activity seems to fade away. 92 However, when we look at the trends in EDCSx (n=106,382), the dataset without the duplicate EDH records, represented by the red color, we see a different trend than in EDCS or EDH. The total values of epigraphic evidence through time are lower in the EDCSx dataset than in EDCS, as records shared with EDH were removed. This deduplication made EDCSx one third smaller and removed the peak of the Antonine era around AD 200 that dominated the EDH. All in all, epigraphic activity in all three datasets starts in the first century BC, but while EDH shows a slow, gradual increase through the end of the second century AD, EDCSx here follows the EDCS rise and reaches a maximum point nearly instantly. This first and highest peak of epigraphic activity under Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD) is followed by a gradual but inexorable decline until the second half of the third century AD. After a brief plateau, the number of inscriptions in EDCSx recovers and starts rising again during the fourth century AD. This new growth in EDCSx, while robust and century-long, nonetheless, never reaches the levels seen during the first and second centuries AD. 93 The diachronic trends of growth and decline clearly vary between the datasets, partially due to the selection of contents. High numbers of inscriptions from the Augustan era characterize the EDCS dataset, while the Antonine peak is best documented in the EDH. Declining numbers of the epigraphic remains during the third century AD, often connected with the socio-economic crisis of the Roman Empire, are observable in both datasets. While this decline seems permanent in EDH data, EDCS, and EDCSx datasets show recovery after AD 300. 94 Although the long-term trends rise and fall differently across the datasets and differ in magnitude, many of the spikes along these curves are shared and converge around the same dates. Inscription numbers spike across the Roman West during the Augustan era (14 BC - AD 27), the Antonine era (AD 97 - AD 192) and the Severan era (AD 193 - AD 235) ( Nawotka 2020 , 230). These synchronized spikes, rather than representing actual empire-wide phenomena such as the sudden massive issue of new inscriptions, are likely an artefact of editorial decisions. The authors of the editio princeps would often assign the inscriptions the start and the end date coterminous with the boundaries of historical periods such as the Augustan era (14 BC - AD 27), or known historical events, such as the issue of Constitutio Antoniniana in AD 212. Established cultural periods were used as meaningful anchors for relative dates and we can now feel their mark in the visualisations. 95 Plotting EDH, EDCS and EDCSx side-by-side in Figure 1 , we can see that each dataset yields a different long-term trend. Even though the EDH and EDCS projects are interested in the same historical material from the same time periods, their digital collections diverge considerably. In order to better understand the differences, we now explore the contents and the geographic distribution of inscriptions within both sources. 96 Public and private: two ends to a continuum Previous observations of the changes in epigraphic trends were based on private inscriptions, specifically funerary texts ( MacMullen 1982 ; Meyer 1990 ; Woolf 1996 ). It is unclear whether the observed trends apply to other types of inscriptions (non-private, non-funerary), and so we shall review the diachronic development of inscriptions by their type. 97 Distinguishing between private and public epigraphy can be a subjective task. We can categorize inscriptions according to the status of the commissioner (private person vs. public authority), the context of discovery (public building vs. private object) or the intended audience (e.g. forum visitors vs. defixiones (curse tablets not intended to be read)), but none of these approaches is bulletproof. For the purpose of this study, we follow the ongoing discussion within the Epigraphy.info Vocabulary Working Group and use the commissioning entity behind an inscription to make the assignment. Private inscriptions are texts commissioned and executed on behalf of individuals or social groups not acting in the capacity of an institution or in a religious role. This group thus encompasses funerary inscriptions commemorating someone’s death, votive inscriptions celebrating or thanking a deity, ownership inscriptions identifying the owner of the inscribed object, inscriptions connected with the manufacturing process, identifying the maker or the process itself. Public inscriptions , conversely, are inscriptions issued by a person or group of people acting within an institutional or legal role, potentially having an impact on the public sphere. In this category, we can typically find regulatory documents, such as laws and decrees, inscriptions informing of various building activities, milestones, inscriptions delimiting the boundaries, and certifications of social status, such as military diplomas or manumissions. In some instances, the private and public sphere cannot be entirely separated, as the same type was used for monuments published on behalf of a public authority as well as a private individual or social group. 98 For the purpose of temporal comparison of epigraphic types, we use the subset of dated inscriptions from both datasets: EDH (n=59,788) and EDCSx (n=106,382). Both datasets contain the attribute inscription_type , however, its content is mutually incompatible. EDH dataset operates with 22 unique categories if we count only labels stripped of any markers of uncertainty, such as question-mark, associated with the categorisation of an inscription. The EDCSx dataset contains 16 unique categories of inscription type, with an average of 1.08 types per inscription and a maximum of five labels ( inscription genus/titulorum distributio ) per inscription. Moreover, the typological categories of EDH and EDCS do not always correspond to one another, with variants of the former overlapping with several of the categories in the second source. For instance, the category of owner/artist inscription in EDH does not exist in EDCS but can be conceptually divided into two categories tituli possessionis and tituli fabricationis . 106 Figure 2 shows that the vast majority of inscriptions in both EDH and EDCSx were published privately, on behalf of individuals or private groups, and not on behalf of a public authority. The funerary inscriptions represent the most numerous group of private inscriptions in both datasets ( epitaph in EDH, tituli sepulcrales in EDCSx), both steeply rising in number around the time of Augustus and dropping after AD 200 (Bodel 2001, 7). The second most numerous group consists of votive inscriptions in EDH and Christian inscriptions in EDCSx ( inscriptiones christianae ). The votive inscriptions ( tituli sacri ) in EDCSx represent the third most numerous group, prominent during the second century AD. The rise in votive inscriptions in EDH seems delayed by circa one hundred years when compared to the funerary inscriptions. Funerary and votive inscriptions in EDH and EDCSx, however, start decreasing around the same time, after AD 200. The number of inscriptions continues to decline during the entire third century AD, making it a society-wide phenomenon observable in both data sources. 107 Inscriptions published on behalf of political authorities, such as honorific inscriptions, building inscriptions, and milestones, are represented in both sources in relatively low quantities and with delayed onset when compared to the group of inscriptions published by the private sphere. The increase in building inscriptions in EDH before the middle of the second century AD may correspond with the provincial building programme of emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138; Wilson 2012 , 163). In EDCS, the number of inscriptions related to building activities, tituli operum , grew already during the late Republic and the first century AD to around 300 inscriptions per 25 years, possibly related to the imperial building program in Rome ( Bodel 2001 , 7). The decrease in the number of building inscriptions after AD 200 is gradual yet continuous throughout the third century AD, mirroring the private inscriptions. 108 Milestones ( miliaria ) are a category of public inscriptions erected along roads to relate the distance to the administrative centre ( caput viae ) and to provide information on who and when financed the road (re)construction. Roads were already built during the Roman Republic, but contemporary milestones survived in comparatively low numbers. With the beginning of the Imperial period, we see an increase in the number of milestones ( Bodel 2001 , 7), varying between 50 (EDH) and 120 (EDCSx) surviving milestones per 25 years. The growth in the number of milestones is evident in both sources during the third century AD and the beginning of the fourth century AD, at which point up to 300 inscriptions in 25 years were produced according to both datasets. The period of increased survival rate of milestones coincides with the extensive building of the road network in the provinces in the second century AD ( Laurence 1999 , 52; Kolb 2019 , 8-10). The milestones from the third and fourth centuries point to maintenance work and reconstruction of the road system, suggesting the provincial institutions maintaining the road network were still active and commissioning inscriptions, while privately commissioned epigraphic remains in the provinces are at a minimum. 109 Honorific inscriptions, straddling the divide between private and public texts, show a similar trend as private inscriptions, observed already by Wilson ( Wilson 2012 ). There is an increase in the first half of the first century AD, followed by steady levels of 200-300 honorific inscriptions per 25-year-long time blocks. The number of honorific inscriptions peaks between AD 200-225 after which it declines. Although Meyer ( Meyer 1990 ) was using funerary rather than honorific inscriptions to illustrate the decline of epigraphic habit, a similar trend in the honorific inscriptions after AD 200 suggests conceptual closeness of both categories. 110 The category of Christian inscriptions deviates from the typological pattern. Appearing only in EDCSx, the label inscriptiones christianae refers to a religious context of an inscription rather than its social function. It is a new category alongside funerary, votive, or ownership type. The vast majority (94.4 %) of dated Christian inscriptions in EDCSx are also labelled as funerary ( tituli sepulcrales ), therefore belonging primarily to a private funerary context. As to their temporal trend, the Christian funerary inscriptions deviate from the trends of non-Christian funerary inscriptions, as they only start to appear after AD 200, when the rest of funerary texts decline. On the contrary, the number of Christian funerary inscriptions increases around AD 300 on a massive scale (3000-3500 inscriptions per 25 years). At the same time, all other types of inscriptions become almost non-existent. To position the numbers in a discipline-specific context, it is worth noting that periods after AD 300 may be underrepresented in our sources as Late Antique inscriptions are often collected by specialised projects and databases, and they are missing in the systematic collection in the large digital corpora ( Trout 2009 , 171; Roueché, Sotinel 2017 , 503-507). 111 The typological overview of inscriptions across EDH and EDCS in Figure 2 shows more shared patterns than an undifferentiated dataset-wide comparison in Figure 1 . First, we can see a clear divide in both datasets between the public and private sphere. While the private inscriptions, represented mostly by funerary and votive texts, follow the same pattern as observed by MacMullen and Meyer, the public inscriptions are linked to the activities of political authorities, such as various building programs and maintenance of the road network. Thus, the epigraphic habit with its rise and fall at the turn of the third century AD does apply to the private sphere, while the public inscriptions exhibit a gently upward trend that follows the continually growing demand on the maintenance of the technical infrastructure in an expanding Empire. The temporal simulations represented by each line in Figure 2 point to variable levels of temporal uncertainty in private and public inscriptions across both datasets. Private texts, such as funerary and votive inscriptions, contain a higher level of uncertainty, represented by thicker respective trendlines. The lower level of uncertainty in public inscriptions, represented by narrower trendlines, corresponds to the fact that public inscriptions often contain more characteristic elements, such as references to historical events, people or calendars, enabling epigraphers to establish a more precise date than private inscriptions. 112 The aggregated dataset-wide comparison in Figure 1 attests to sampling differences between datasets, raising questions of representativeness and provenance. The typological comparison in Figure 2 reveals similarities between public and private inscriptions across datasets. While Figure 1 and Figure 2 allow us to gauge the large picture of the epigraphic categories through time, we need to remember that the dataset has a continental scale and that regional variation is flattened and collated here. In the next section, we investigate regional variation by mapping the surviving epigraphic monuments from EDH and EDCSx within the extent of the Roman Empire. 113 Geography of epigraphic monuments through historic eras In order to explore the changing provenance of epigraphic remains, we create a series of maps showing the distribution of inscription findspots in eight given historical periods. Plotting inscriptions by source and historical period makes it possible to both assess their spatial distribution across the Roman Empire and evaluate potential blindspots of the datasets. Such an approach would benefit from the addition of other large-scale longitudinal and geospatial datasets from the Ancient Mediterranean, such as the distribution of coin finds, pottery assemblages, road network, settlement patterns and many others ( Bowman, Wilson 2009 ; Wilson 2009 ). 114 For the purpose of spatiotemporal comparison of EDCS and EDH, we use the filtered EDCSx dataset without duplicate records from EDH. We use only inscriptions that are both dated, and their spatial coordinates are located within the borders of the Roman Empire within its largest extent in AD 117 (EDH n=55,431, EDCSx n=90,281 records). For definition of the maximum spatial extent of the Roman Empire in AD 117, we are using the pleiades-regions-magis-pelagios.geojson , based on the Barrington Atlas of Greek and Roman World, available through Pelagios on GitHub . The subplots in Figure 3 are based on one time-series simulation of the whole EDH and EDCSx datasets and on the geographic coordinates provided by the authors of the databases with all its biases and errors (see above). That means that each inscription is randomly assigned to one singular year. In theory, an inscription dated to the second century AD might become part of three subplots, but in practice, it is included only in one of them. Every time we generate the random dates, the maps slightly change as some inscriptions may shift from one historical period to another; but the general pattern remains the same. 128 Although the historical periods have a different duration and thus longer periods will naturally contain more inscriptions, the division to historic periods better corresponds to the temporal interval assigned in the original corpora, i.e. Augustan era (27 BC - AD 14) or the Severan dynasty (AD 193 - AD 235). The main advantage of the time series approach is that we can transform inscriptions of the uneven length of their temporal interval, and with the uneven level of uncertainty of their dating, to the same format, and then contrast the extent of the epigraphic monuments within the historical periods traditionally used by historians using the data in homogenous format. 129 Some of the differences between the two datasets observed in the previous sections are even more visible in Figure 3 . We can see the clear spatial focus of EDCSx, styled in red, on Rome and Italic provinces throughout all historical periods, while EDH spatial coverage, styled in blue, focuses on the northern provinces, such as Britannia, both Germanias, Noricum, both Pannonias and Hispania in the south. The areas of Northern Africa, Gaul and Greece, where the epigraphic habit of the Severan period has been traditionally observed, do not yield as many inscriptions in our sources. 130 When contrasted in time, the first observed period of epigraphic activity during the Late Roman Republic (200 BC - 27 BC) shows low levels of activity, mostly in Rome and Italic provinces, Hispania, Greece and Asia Minor. The majority of these places have a tradition of publication of inscriptions in Greek in the previous periods, and some of the trends may be partially documented also in EDH and EDCSx as both contain a small number of Greek inscriptions. The extensive development of provincial epigraphic activity around the Limes Romanus is noticeable during the second and early third century AD during the Nerva-Antonine period (AD 97 - AD 192) and the Severan period (AD 193 - AD 235) and is predominantly fueled by the data from EDH. 131 Because of its uneven length, the historical periods may not be the most efficient way to visualize the quantity of epigraphic monuments. However, traditional periodization still has its stable place in historical narratives, and they provide a wider socio-cultural framework for any historical debate. The comparable format of the temporal data, created by the MCM temporal approach, enables us to transform the epigraphic records with available spatial coordinates into a more dynamic series of maps, representing spatial trends in eight cumulative snapshots of the past. The main benefit of the spatial visualization of epigraphic data divided into historical periods is clear communication of the spatial distinction between the two datasets and the level of their bias towards collecting inscriptions with a focus on one area (EDCSx) or along the border of the Empire (EDH). By slicing the epigraphic remains in time and space, we have discovered that spatial bias (e.g. low number of inscriptions in Gaul) is present throughout all the subplots, in total representing the 800-year-long time span, varying only in the intensity of activities and/or survival rate in a given period. 132 The continent-wide scale and temporal slices in spatial visualisations do not lend themselves easily to expressing the spatial uncertainty of the dataset. Spatial uncertainty is, nonetheless, captured in the data and should be considered in more specific or regional studies. The curious reader is welcome to use the streamlined dataset and apply some of the visualisation approaches that focus on rendering uncertainty (e.g. Brodlie, Allendes Osorio, Lopes 2012 ; Johnson, Sanderson 2003 ). 133 Global or local? In order to investigate spatial variation in the adoption of epigraphic habit, we display epigraphic activity by province, focusing on a subset of ten provinces with the highest number of epigraphic remains in the databases. Can we see similar trends across all these provinces, or does location play a role? 134 For the comparison of provincial trends in time, we use a subset of dated inscriptions from both datasets EDH (n=59,788) and EDCS(n=164,452). We use attributes containing province names in a textual format as provided by the EDH and EDCS, including any potential inconsistencies present in the data ( Lotz 2020 ). As we adopt the assignment to individual provinces as stated in their respective source, we should bear in mind the assignment is fixed and does not reflect the spatial variation in some of the provincial boundaries in time. 135 Figure 4 demonstrates that most dated inscriptions in EDH (n=59,788) come from the provinces on the northern border of the Roman Empire, such as Britannia, both Germanias, Noricum, or from the Adriatic provinces, such as Dalmatia and both Pannonias. However, the state of the data entry in EDH and its completeness plays an important role in the order of particular provinces and the preserved trends. As the EDH states on its website, most of the provinces on the northern border of the Empire were entered fully, with the exception of data entry from Germanias and Belgica, where the data entry is still in progress. The provinces located in Asia Minor, Northern Africa, and in modern-day France are entered into the database only provisionally, and thus the data from EDH is not as representative for them as it is for other provinces. Moreover, the Italic provinces are well under-represented in EDH, with the capital Rome, for example, containing only 2415 dated inscriptions. 139 The cacophony of lines in Figure 4 shows that epigraphic survival in each of the ten provinces has a different trajectory. Historical circumstances, such as the date and manner of annexation to the Empire, affect the onset and steepness of each curve. The timing of pacification activities, movement of armies, settlement of new populations impact the 25-year trends in each province. The second half of the second century AD marks the highest levels of inscriptions for most provinces except Britannia, where the total numbers spike in the first half of the second century AD, and Noricum, where the maximum sits at 100 AD. The province with the most numerous inscriptions is Dalmatia (n=7,493). The epigraphic tradition continues here even after AD 300, while in other provinces, it almost disappears around AD 300. The decline starts after AD 200 in both Germanias, Dacia and Pannonia Inferior, while other provinces, such as Dalmatia, Britannia and partially Pannonia Superior, record the main drop in the number of inscriptions only after AD 300. 140 The numbers of records behind the individual provincial trajectories show that the data in EDH is relatively uniformly distributed across the sampled provinces. Such distribution is good for comparative analyses of cultural development in the provinces, especially if it is representative of actual published records and if the biases are also equally distributed. However, in the case of selected provinces, the extent of temporal uncertainty in some periods is relatively high, especially at this level of the data-granularity. In particular, it appears that the change between the second half of the second century AD and the first half of the third century might be less prominent than commonly assumed, especially in Germania Superior, Dacia or Dalmatia. EDCS dataset, on the other hand, contains massive outliers, such as Rome, which has an order of magnitude more data than most other findspots. While the dominance of Rome probably reflects a real difference in the magnitude of production between Rome and other parts of the empire, it subdues other trends in the chart and makes them hard to read. The skewness can be filtered away of course, but it is good to be aware of such issues for spatial analysis or other studies that require fairly uniform coverage. 141 A substantial portion of dated inscriptions in the EDCS dataset (n=164,452) in Figure 5 comes from Rome and its immediate surroundings, such as the province Latium et Campania, Venetia et Histria, or Samnium. The Italic provinces, and the city of Rome, represent over 45 % of the entire dataset, skewing the attention or any computations in favour of the capital. The non-Italic provinces producing most inscriptions in EDCS are the same ones as in EDH, such as Dalmatia, Hispania Citerior, Germania Superior, Dacia, Pannonia Superior, and Britannia. Pannonia Inferior, Germania Inferior, and Noricum are, on the other hand missing in the overview of the ten provinces with the most inscriptions based on EDCS dataset. 147 For historiographic reasons discussed in the Data Sources section , the Italic provinces and Rome are not represented well in EDH, but EDCS provides a good overview of epigraphic evidence from Rome and its surrounding provinces. The trends in non-Italic provinces follow similar patterns as in EDH, with few exceptions, such as Dacia or Germania Superior. The varying status of documentation of inscriptions from those provinces in both sources likely plays its role: EDCS contains 5,008 inscriptions from Dacia, while EDH only has 3,484, with approximately one-third of inscriptions missing after AD 200. The same applies to Germania Superior, where EDH contains 6,557 inscriptions while EDCS 5,046, with the highest discrepancy in the number of inscriptions around the year AD 200 – which also corresponds with the period of maximal activity that interests the researchers of the epigraphic habit . 148 In the case of the epigraphic evidence from Rome, we witness three periods of growth of the total number of inscriptions: in the first half of the first century AD, around the middle of the second century AD and during the fourth century AD. In total, the province Roma, representing the territory of the capital Rome, is associated with by far the most dated inscriptions (n=46,695) in the EDCS dataset, followed by Latium and Campania (n=15,894). Province Latium et Campania (n=17,852) follows a similar trend as Rome in the first and the second century AD, but not during the fourth century AD. The spatial proximity of both provinces suggests mutual influence on epigraphic trends, Latium being driven by the epigraphic activity of Rome between the first and the third century AD. Thus, the EDCS dataset has value for the study of epigraphic trends in the Italic provinces but may provide a biased overview when studying epigraphic cultures in non-Italic provinces. 149 To bring out the unique data in EDCS more clearly, we also plot the inscriptions by province using the filtered EDCSx dataset (n=106,382). Figure 6 now shows only the data that is only present in the EDCS dataset and complementary to EDH. It is useful for comparison with EDH as it is less cluttered now that all the EDH duplicates have been stripped away. As one might expect, EDCSx is even more dominated by the inscriptions from Rome and Italic provinces than EDCS. Other differences emerge. For example, the inscriptions from Germania Superior in the EDCSx dataset (bright orange line) spike in the second half of the first century AD and cease almost completely after AD 100. In EDH (orange color on Figure 4 ), the peak of epigraphic remains in Germania comes at the beginning of the third century AD. The third-century peak becomes a secondary bump, partially visible in EDCS (orange color on Figure 5 ), and is completely missing in the EDCSx dataset. 156 The example of Germania Superior confirms that trends can change dramatically depending on which data-source and attributes we select. If we have a particular region in mind, we need to consider data quality and completeness before choosing a dataset. Reviewing the figures 4 - 6 reminds us that spatial visualisation and analysis based solely on EDCS or EDCSx dataset is bound to be heavily skewed towards Rome and Italic provinces. 157 Zooming on Rome Both Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate that Rome represents an outlier, the area with the highest concentration of inscriptions when compared to other provinces. Inscriptions from Rome comprise 40 % of EDCSx and their long-term trend is distinct from those observed in most provinces. In order to better understand the factors contributing to the temporal distribution of inscriptions from Rome, we need to look at individual types of inscriptions over time. As EDH only contains 2,415 dated inscriptions from Rome, EDCSx with a dataset of over 40,000+ inscriptions offers a better picture. Figure 7 is based on dated inscriptions from Rome in the EDCSx dataset (n=43,392), containing at least one or more labels, determining their type. 163 The epigraphic record of Rome is dominated by funerary inscriptions, representing 76.5 % (33,197) of inscriptions recorded by EDCSx (n=43,392). As seen in Figure 7 , the temporal trend of Rome does not follow the classic pattern of epigraphic habit , even if we consider solely the funerary inscriptions ( tituli sepulcrales ). The number of funerary inscriptions grew rapidly during the Augustan era (27 BC - 14 AD), coinciding with the imperial expansion and the supply of quality marble from Carrara ( Bodel 2001 , 7). The total number of inscriptions remained relatively stable until the second half of the second century AD. The third century AD saw a drop in the number of funerary inscriptions, but not as stark as observed in other provinces. Around AD 300, the number of inscriptions increased substantially as a result of the of Christian funerary inscriptions, i.e. inscriptions which are classified both as tituli sepulcrales and inscriptiones christianae , being dated by default to AD 300-500 by authors of EDCS. The inscriptions, labelled by the editors of the EDCS database as Christian, form the second most numerous typological group in Rome (n=20,072). They start to grow around AD 200, but they gain substantial popularity in AD 300. The Christian funerary inscriptions continue to be produced in large numbers between 3000 and 3500 inscriptions per 25 years until AD 400 when their numbers drop approximately 50 %, and it sharply declines and almost disappears after AD 500 ( Bodel 2001 , 6). The high numbers of Christian inscriptions in Rome coincide with the building and use of catacombs as a place for funerary rites and a final resting place for Christians ( Trout 2009 , 175). Yet, as Trout and others correctly point out, the Christian and Late Antique inscriptions are published and studied separately from the pre-Constantian inscriptions and thus are likely underrepresented in large epigraphic databases, with EDCS being an exception ( Trout 2009 , 171; Roueché, Sotinel 2017 , 503-507). 164 Another anomalous pattern in the EDCSx dataset can be observed in the tituli fabricationis , i.e. inscriptions related to the manufacturing process, that carry an artist’s signature or workshop stamps ( sigilla impressa ). Almost all the tituli fabricationis from Rome come from the first quarter of the second century AD and are made on pottery (84 %) or lead (11.7 %) (cyan color on Figure 5 and 6 ). This concentration of tituli fabricationis in Rome in the first quarter of the second century AD, however, is not necessarily evidence for growing pottery production in Rome or for a sudden change in cultural norms around pottery manufacturing at that time. It is more likely an effect of archaeological discovery of one or more workshops and the subsequent documentation of their stamped products by EDR and EDCS (e.g. Bloch 1947 ; Bloch 1967 ). 165 Having the data in a comparable format, we were able to get a more nuanced image of the development in time within regional political subunits, potentially showing local variations within the epigraphic production but also responses to contemporary societal development. The state of data entry of individual datasets, as well as their regionalized data collection, become a factor seriously impacting any meaningful outcome. Thus, any quantitative research should start with a careful selection of the source, as some sources are more fitting to different types of analysis than others. The EDCSx dataset, for example, is ideal for researching urban environments and the role of urbanism on the character of epigraphic evidence, or how the character of funerary inscriptions changed with Christianity, while the EDH dataset is better suited for analysis of provincial, non-urbanized environments along the Limes Romanus . 166 Removing the barriers and opening new avenues in digital epigraphy: Discussion 167 To summarize the main results of this article, the comparison of data from EDH and EDCS shows that these datasets have very different spatial and temporal coverage which might not be immediately apparent from their websites. EDH offers data that is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the northwestern provinces of the Empire while they under-represent Rome, the capital. When making a temporal plot of the EDH data grouped by province, we can see an equitable overview of provinces, each line showing the trajectory of provincial epigraphic evidence. EDCS is several times larger than EDH, but rather than qualifying the Empire-wide trends seen in EDH, the additional records relate to Rome and Italic provinces, skewing the dataset considerably. This non-uniform distribution becomes clear in EDCS-based charts, where the trends from Rome and Italy overshadow all other data. While EDCS shares most province records with EDH, these are barely perceptible in the visualizations and require filtering to bring out. For studies that require uniform distribution of data across provinces; therefore, EDH is a better alternative. For studies centred on Rome and Italy, be it urban scaling or adoption of Christianity, EDCS will be more suitable. 168 In terms of temporal developments, the highest levels of epigraphic activity in EDH across most provinces fall into the second century AD, despite regional differences in interim peaks and rates of growth and decline. This coincides with rapid socio-economic development along with the northern parts of Limes Romanus ( Verhagen, Vossen, Groenhuijzen, Joyce 2016 , 313; Hanel 2020 ; Kemkes 2020 ). The records in EDCS, centred on Italic provinces, show the highest levels of epigraphic activity in the Augustan and Flavian era in the first century AD, showing imperial expansion, and in the fourth century AD, reflecting the building activities in Rome, or underneath in the catacombs respectively ( Bodel 2001 , 7; Trout 2009 , 171). 169 When investigating the trends by inscription type, we see that private and public inscriptions differ considerably in their distributions, especially between Italy and the rest of the Empire. Private inscriptions in the provinces, represented mostly by funerary texts in EDH, follow the trend articulated by MacMullen ( MacMullen 1982 ) and Meyer ( Meyer 1990 ). Numbers rise at the turn of the second and the third century with a final peak in the Severan period. It is followed by a dramatic drop and disappearance of inscriptions in the second half of the third century AD, after which only 10 % of the maximum levels survive ( Figure 2 . Private inscriptions in the urbanized environment of Rome and Italy from EDCS enjoy the highest numbers in the first and the fourth century AD, respectively. Severan peak observed in the evidence from the provinces ( Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 ) is absent from Rome and Italic provinces ( Figure 7 ). A secondary peak during the Antonine period is the last vestige of activity before the third century drop that characterizes the urbanized Italic record, cf. ( Figures 5 and 6 ) 170 In order to test MacMullen’s or Meyer’s hypothesis of inscriptions being co-opted in the competition for social status, further exploration of how social prestige is expressed or generated through the inscriptions before and after AD 212 is needed. While a combination of the temporal modelling with text mining approaches should make this avenue of analysis possible, the combination of close and distant reading is out of the scope of the present paper. 171 Similarly, quantitative province-specific analysis can help evaluate alternative explanations of the decline in private funerary inscriptions such as the role of infectious diseases and decimation of the population of the Roman Empire. Scholars estimate that the outbreaks of the so-called Antonine Plague in AD 165 and AD 189 killed off between 10 and 30 % of the entire population of the Roman Empire ( Duncan-Jones 1996 ; Duncan-Jones 2018 ; Harper 2016 , 806; Littman, Littman 1973 , 252; Verhagen 2019 ). Few models provide theoretical framework for the effect of plague (potentially combining both the population decline with the increase in relative wages, cf. Scheidel 2018 ) on the production of inscription. One could expect that the increased mortality would drive up the demand for funerary inscriptions in the short-term, i.e. at the time of plague. However, population attrition would lead to inscriptions being created at lower levels in the long term, provided that the cultural practice remains unchanged. It might be worthwhile to inspect the effect of infectious diseases on the distribution of private inscriptions empirically and review Duncan-Jones' ( Duncan-Jones 1990 ; Duncan-Jones 1996 ; Duncan-Jones 2018 ) results in light of the larger dataset. 172 The public inscriptions, such as the building inscriptions often used to reflect the economic performance of the Empire ( Wilson 2009 ), peak around mid-second century AD in EDH. In EDCS they peak in the first decades of the first century AD, then decline to 75 % of the maximum levels and remain relatively stable also in the second century AD. The third century is marked by a gradual decline of building inscriptions in both datasets but this situation is not as dramatic as the disappearance of funerary inscriptions, with the levels of building inscriptions dropping to ca 50-40 % of the previous century, with steeper decline marked in EDH. The number of preserved milestones, another marker of the maintenance capacity of the Empire, goes up compared to the previous periods. Specifically, the number of milestones in both sources is more-or-less constant in both sources until AD 200 when the number of surviving milestones rises twofold in EDCS and threefold in EDH. With the exception of Christian funerary inscriptions from the catacombs of Rome, milestones are the only type of inscriptions with an increasing trend after AD 200. Both these trends suggest that the construction of public buildings and public infrastructure continued as was necessary for the survival of the Empire. A possible explanation, that however needs to be verified, may be a conflict induced pressure on quick transfer of the Roman armies across the Empire and their supplies during the third century AD, that resulted in road networks being built and reconstructed, along with the milestones, when other types of activities that tend to reflect in epigraphic record were subdued ( Hollenstein 1975 ; Madzharov 2009 ). 173 One must tamper these observations with concern over digital data sources, specifically the state of inscription documentation and the representativeness of each dataset. Data digitisation is a time-consuming and expensive task, and few institutions have the funds to make it complete ( Sherratt 2019 ). Being able to view long-term cumulative trends, we can start asking what may be missing and why? While the EDH authors assert their emphasis on collecting all data from the provinces, the digitization is still work-in-progress and may not be concluded due to the funding cutoff by the end of 2021. On their website , authors of EDCS state the database contains 99.5 % of all published Latin inscriptions ( Lotz 2020 ). Such a number inspires confidence in EDCS as a source. Yet, only approximately one third of the EDCS records contains some chronological information, and can be employed in the temporal analyses. The claim of completeness brings up additional questions, such as what fraction of Latin inscriptions from the Roman Empire have been published and have all publication venues (limited-edition regional journals or museum bulletins) been consulted? Likewise, the analysis of EDCS shows that inscriptions from Italic provinces and Rome exceed those from other parts of the Empire by an order of magnitude. Is this a real and trustworthy trend, reflecting the longer duration of Roman culture in this part of the world, or is it the result of the bias of Romanists and Early Christianity scholars who preferentially catalogued inscriptions in the core of the Empire? 174 Has it been worth it? Looking at the results above, one could argue that these are moderate achievements that do not present any overwhelming surprises and require more interpretive work to properly explain and contextualize. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, scepticism here equates to missing the forest for individual trees. While the epigraphic habit serves as a linchpin for the study, the real contribution here is in analyzing and plotting, for the first time, all of the available EDH and EDCS data in a single graph with comparable scales. The use of digital tools allowed us to work with both datasets efficiently in a reproducible way. Using probabilistic modelling we placed all dated inscriptions on a temporal axis and quantified their count per given time interval. We could filter and quantify other inscription attributes across time and compare them within and between datasets. Working with datasets in their entirety not only reveals their internal complexity but provides a more transparent route to addressing interpretive and conceptual problems. To make such comparisons possible, we built infrastructure that allows us and other scholars access and inspect entire datasets. While it took us months of time and programming skills to develop, it now takes hours to days and basic computational skills to reuse. The example of the epigraphic habit merely demonstrates the potential of SDAM infrastructure for large-scale historical and epigraphic studies. The real value of this paper is in sharing tools that facilitate access to and streamline large "messy" datasets, removing the barriers to high-quality quantitative epigraphic research. 175 Removing barriers to quantitative research is essential for both the community and the digital archive owners, as it can mitigate low rates of reuse and combat insufficient research transparency. The epigraphic community has done a tremendous amount of work collecting and digitizing both datasets for Latin epigraphy, Epigraphic Database Heidelberg (EDH) and Epigraphic Database Clauss-Slaby (EDCS). This effort, however, has seen only selective quantified studies, making it hard to justify continued funding of these platforms (for similar discourse in archaeology, see Huggett 2016 ; Huggett 2017 ). The need to scrape EDCS before quantitative analysis blocks research. Uncertainty and heterogeneous temporal span of individual inscriptions in EDH limits the amount of immediately accessible analysis-ready data to barely 12 % (59,788) of all available epigraphic records across EDCS and EDH (500,000+). Removing these blockers not only leads to improved knowledge of the past, but facilitates the long-term maintenance and sustainability of the existing digital resources. 176 Selective use of data, justified by difficulties of reconciling heterogeneous and broad dates, has reduced research transparency in the past. While growing and declining trend lines based on 10-year-dated inscription data propped up arguments for economic well-being (or lack thereof), the authors were rarely able to provide an indication of how reliable these trends truly were. Our work makes it possible to contextualize even tiny subsets within the bulk of epigraphic evidence, and ascertain how representative and reliable trends in different inscription categories are in their regional and temporal context. This fulfills the requirements of transparent scientific practice which calls on researchers to share complete results including the data that does not support their hypotheses. 177 Finally, after the creation of major digital data sources, the community also needs to build an ecosystem where data from these disparate sources can be combined and analyzed. Two approaches are possible here. In the first, database owners coordinate and gradually build interoperability between their respective infrastructures. Complexity of this approach rises with the number of participating databases as they all need to agree on standards. Progress towards community standards has been started by the epigraphic community who created a widely accepted EpiDoc XML/TEI format, paving the path towards interoperability of resources ( Bodard 2008 ; Cayless, Roueché, Elliott, Bodard 2010 ; Elliott, Bodard, Mylonas, Stoyanova, Tupman, Vanderbilt 2020 ).  This initiative, started by the EAGLE Europeana Project in 2013, is now carried on by the professional community around Epigraphy.info, who promote and train researchers in the use of the EpiDoc standard so that new epigraphic datasets and databases enable quantitative and synthetic research ( Feraudi-Gruénais, Grieshaber 2016 ; Liuzzo 2018 ; Bodard, Cayless, Cenati, Cooley, Elliott, Evangelisti, Felicetti, Granados, Grieshaber, Gruber, Hershkowitz, Hill, Kiiskinen, Kollatz, Levivier, Liuzzo, Luciani, Mannocci, Mataix, Murano, Murphy, Mylonas, Prag, Razanajao, Stoyanova, Tsolakis, Tupman, Vagionakis, Vitale, Weise 2021 ). The resulting interoperability with other EpiDoc-based collections, such as EDH, is encouraging, but the overall effort remains limited as it affects only newly-created data. Existing giants, such as the EDCS or PHI ( Packard Humanities Institute’s project cataloguing all Greek inscriptions; Iversen 2007 ), lag behind. EDCS, the largest epigraphic database of Latin inscriptions, does not follow the EpiDoc standard and users of its data face time-consuming manual reconciliation. This pushes the goal - the proliferation of synthetic quantitative studies - into the future ( Avanzini, De Santis, Rossi 2018 ). Lack of funding, institutional support, and technical feasibility impede engineering towards a common standard, with responsibility resting on the shoulders of database owners. Convergence and dissemination of community standards is likewise slow, driven by volunteers and supported by short-term funding rounds. 178 An alternative approach is to build federation tools and pipelines alongside the developing datastores. Any sufficiently skilled members of the epigraphic community can build tools to extract the data from multiple data sources, transform them to a standardized form, and then combine them for visualisation and analysis (i.e. Liuzzo 2019 ). When designed in consultation with domain experts, such pipelines can build interoperability within a domain gradually and reduce the computational barriers to quantified research. Open-source tools improve the sustainability of these pipelines as the burden of upkeep can be shared by many potential maintainers ( Raymond 2001 ). Adherence to the principles of open science and collaboration improves the quality and flexibility of the resulting toolkit, with the goal being a robust and generalized workflow which researchers can adapt to their needs. Demonstrating the feasibility of this approach has been the goal of the present paper. FAIR and Open approach takes time and commitment. We spent a total of six months over the course of a one and a half year scoping, designing and developing tools that would be robust, reproducible, yet accessible to anyone with Carpentries training (www.carpentries.org) . Having invested into reproducible, generalised and scalable approaches, we can now apply the tools to any data that contain spatial and temporal attributes with varying levels of uncertainty, not only Latin epigraphic datasets. Finally, having all analyses scripted and documented, allows anyone to build upon our work without having to reinvent the wheel. Next time you wish to analyze another epigraphic or archaeological dataset, such as the EDR with its 100,000 records, the release of EDR's public API in early-2022 in combination with this toolkit will make possible to replicate our work on a new dataset in a matter of days or weeks, reaping the benefit of our investment. 179 Conclusions 180 Large epigraphic datasets represented by EDCS (500,000+ records) and EDH (81,000+ records) have long been accessible online, but most efforts to aggregate and quantify these datasets have been stalled by the technological and methodological challenges of streamlining large amounts of "messy" data. Incompatible data types and data structures combined with temporal uncertainty have restricted reuse to the highest-quality fraction of the available data. 181 In this paper we deploy a suite of open-source tools that we co-developed with the aim to overcome the challenges of large-scale data aggregation and synthesis. We demonstrate the process of rendering EDH and EDCS datasets amenable for quantified analysis. After making the datasets machine-readable and comparable, we explore the concept of epigraphic habit , the variation in epigraphic remains through time in different parts of the Roman Empire. Being able to access the datasets in their entirety, we can qualify past interpretations. The traditional trajectory of the epigraphic production reaches a zenith in AD 200-250 and declines sharply thereafter. Such a trend is clearly visible in the private sphere (funerary inscriptions) of the northwestern provinces. Private texts from Rome and Italic provinces, however, follow an inverse pattern, with the number of inscriptions peaking in the first century AD and then again in the fourth century AD in Rome. The trajectories of public inscriptions in provinces and Rome vary considerably by inscription type, being driven by public works ranging from maintenance to monumental.Thus public building inscriptions peak in the second century AD while road milestones numbers increase into the third and the fourth century AD. 182 A number of other topics may be revisited with these datasets. Given the preponderance of funerary inscriptions in both EDH (42 %) and EDCSx (56 %) questions of funerary habits, demographic trends as well as inferences of connection between plagues and mortality or diffusion of Christianity may be productively probed. We limit the scope to evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the two streamlined datasets, assessing first their suitability for different research questions. 183 Temporal analysis of epigraphic evidence, for example, hinges on at least some temporal information. Such information exists only in ca 33 % of EDCS data (163,380), while the EDH dataset provides temporal metadata in 69 % of its records (56,281). Majority of records in both datasets date to the second half of the first century BC, but plotting of dated inscriptions by type and findspot shows highly regional and idiosyncratic trends. While EDH contains several hundred of dated records till AD 300, EDCS provides dated inscriptions up to AD 500, as demonstrated by Figure 1 . 184 Both sources provide spatial information in the form of Latitude and Longitude (labelled coordinates in EDH), that can be computationally placed on a map, for 97 % of all records. The spatial coordinates are in most cases extracted from linked open datasets, such as Pleiades or Trismegistos, and thus inevitably contain higher levels of uncertainty than e.g. archaeological datasets, that can still be used for regional and transregional spatial studies, but less for site-based and subregional studies. The EDH prevalently contains Latin inscriptions from the Roman provinces, especially in the northern and northwestern parts of the Roman Empire at the expense of Rome and Italic provinces. Conversely, the majority of EDCS records originate from the Italic provinces with its center in Rome, as can be observed on Figure 3 . 185 Those wishing to analyze inscription texts regardless of date, may be interested in the fact that the EDCS corpus is three-times larger than EDH. It, however, neglects all non-Latin text, even if part of the same inscriptions. Although the EDH corpus of texts is smaller in absolute terms, its quality is higher due to the careful editorial review of individual records. It may thus be more suitable for text analysis and distant-reading. The text mining of inscriptions was previously very limited, because of the Leiden markup for the critical text editions. After the application of cleaning scripts, both datasets now contain the attribute clean_text_interpretive_word , that can be subjected to natural language processing or distant reading methods. 186 Anyone interested in reusing our methods and pipelines can do so without extensive knowledge in programming languages. The scripts can be adapted and applied to literary texts, archaeological datasets or any data with chronological attributes with variable levels of uncertainty. Should you want to inspect, reuse, extend, or build upon our work, see the Hermeneutics section as well as our project GitHub . If scripting is not your cup of tea, but you would like to probe the cleaned datasets, you will find them in Zenodo under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 International License ( EDH , EDCS ). Our aim is to provide a low-threshold access to computational methods, promote digital literacy amongst epigraphers, historians and any researchers interested in macro-scale analysis of historical data on a regional and supra-regional level. 187 Building a research pipeline for FAIR and Open digital epigraphy In the current section, we target the first stages of a research lifecycle, such as data access and their streamlining as a key and formative component of any historical analysis. The initial phases of accessing and streamlining the data consume by far the largest amount of project time but yet are not fully recognized as a valid component of research by the broader community, or made peripheral in favour of analysis and discussion of results. We have spent over a year and a half continuously building and testing the pipeline to ensure its applicability to any historic dataset, containing spatial and temporal data with high degree of uncertainty. We documented the full research lifecycle in a series of R and Python scripts, with a primary focus on usability and reproducibility within the historical discipline. 188 Where possible, we used established tools and solutions, such as Github for code storage and version control, https://sciencedata.dk/ as operational data storage, Zenodo for data publication and archivation. Where we lacked existing tool, we built our own, such as the sddk Python package ( Kaše 2021 ) and sdam::request() function within the sdam R package to access the storage space on Sciencedata.dk from within our respective coding environment. By developing such tools, we were able to prevent any data duplication while enhancing the collaboration between Python and R users. 189 Step 1: Data access & collection stage Both EDH and EDCS projects provide a different pathway to the data, bringing both technological and ethical issues that are common to researchers working with digital archives. We have approached the data collection part of the research life-cycle as transparent and FAIR as possible and documented the programmatic access to data in a series of Python scripts. 190 Working with open datasets The path to the EDH dataset was relatively straightforward since the authors have provided a direct access point to the data via ( API ) on their website. Moreover, they have clearly stated the conditions of use of the data reuse by providing the CC BY-SA 4.0 Creative Commons License . We will briefly summarize the steps undertaken and link to the relevant scripts. First, we accessed the Geography API, containing geospatial information of the findspots of inscriptions, and created a JSON file containing geospatial coordinates and names of individual places. For details see the Python script 1_0_py_EXTRACTING-GEOGRAPHIES.ipynb As a second step, we extracted available attributes for all inscriptions from the EDH API and saved them as a JSON file, see details in the Python script 1_1_py_EXTRACTION_edh-inscriptions-from-web-api.ipynb . As a third step, we have extracted additional information that was not present in the APIs from EpiDoc XML/TEI files into a separate JSON, using the Python script [1_2_py_EXTRACTION_edh-xml_files.ipynb]
(https://github.com/sdam-au/EDH_ETL/blob/master/scripts/1_2_py_EXTRACTION_edh-xml_files.ipynb) to ensure we are not missing any crucial piece of information. Next, we have merged all the three JSON files and created an enriched JSON file containing raw data, using the Python script 1_3_py_MERGING_API_GEO_and_XML.ipynb . The enriched dataset, containing data from APIs as well as EpiDoc XML/TEI files was later streamlined and cleaned by a series of R scripts, for details see the section in Hermeneutics, Step 2 on Data cleaning. 191 When the resource was not built as open When accessing the EDCS dataset, we have encountered issues common to any digital researcher. As mentioned in the Data section, the EDCS web interface serves only as an ephemeral gateway to the data, without providing means to save the search results in a reproducible manner, nor programmatic access to the data. Thus, we used a Python-based digital tool (and a Python package lat-epig ), built with the permission of Manfred Clauss and in collaboration with researchers at Macquarie University in Australia ( Ballsun-Stanton, Heřmánková, Laurence 2020 ; Lat Epig, v.1.0 ). The main purpose of the tool is to alleviate some of the technological and methodological inefficiencies of EDCS and enable reproducible and quantitative research of Latin inscriptions to anyone, not requiring any special programming skills. The tool programmatically accesses the web interface of EDCS and saves the search output as a CSV file. Additionally, it preserves the search query metadata in the name of the CSV file in a reproducible manner, so that searches can be replicated and verified. For easy and quick visualisation of the search query results, the tool produces a map of the query results along with the system of Roman Provinces and road network, using the Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations (DARMC) and Pleiades open datasets of the ancient Mediterranean. We have used version 1 ( Ballsun-Stanton, Heřmánková, Laurence 2020 ) of the tool to create individual CSV files for each of the Roman Provinces in EDCS, containing all the inscriptions in a given Province. The resulting dataset from 9 December 2020 contains 500,536 inscriptions. 192 Step 2: Data cleaning & streamlining Having access to large digital datasets does not mean they are in the format required by the software or the researcher ( Borgman 2015 ). Digitised datasets often contain typos, inconsistencies, and attributes that are entered incorrectly or data are missing. Structure, categories and concepts differ between component datasets and need to be reconciled and mapped to one another before aggregation. Wrangling data programmatically, let alone manually, consumes considerable time and requires the help of technical specialists. Despite the time-consuming and collaborative effort, the process is rarely visible and credited in publications (or budgeted for in funding proposals), being overshadowed by the emphasis on results. We consider the data collection and processing stage of the data lifecycle crucial for the analysis. We, therefore, render the data gathering and processing stage transparent and reproducible, allowing other researchers to repeat or modify the study. 193 We created four series of R scripts to streamline the descriptive attributes in both datasets and transform them into a comparable format. Furthermore, we used scripts to transform the text of inscriptions to a format suitable for computational analysis. Applying the scripts, we have programmatically modified thirteen attributes for all 81,476 records in the EDH, resulting in the transformation of 1,059,188 pieces of information. In the EDCS dataset, we streamlined six attributes of 500,536 records, resulting in changes made to 3,003,216 pieces of information. Tasks that would take years of manual editing took approximately three months to complete, including extensive testing and iterative improvements to all four cleaning scripts. In the end, we have two large datasets that are ready to be analysed, but we have also created a reproducible and transparent pipeline for the transformation of epigraphic data that can be applied to other research projects. 194 Attribute cleaning and conflation of information Script for EDH dataset Script for EDCS dataset In the first stage of the cleaning phase, we needed to streamline the multivalued attributes, which combine multiple distinct types of information, such as start and end date, or region name, ancient and modern place in a single field (e.g. Corinth / Korinthos / Corinthus in EDCS-77500174). Storing multiple types of information in one field may be easy to read for humans but violates the rules of normalisation (requiring one value per field, consistent in type across column) and hinders quantification by computers. We decided to separate the types of information into new attributes but kept the original attributes as a control mechanism. This way, we expanded the size of the original dataset from 51 attributes to 71 in the case of EDH and from 15 to 27 for the EDCS dataset. We demonstrate the cleaning process on the type_of_inscription attribute in EDH, containing an unconstrained textual description of the typological category of an inscription and information about certainty of such categorisation (represented by a question mark). We have created new attributes containing only the information about the typology of inscriptions in one ( type_of_inscription_clean ) and the certainty information in other ( type_of_inscription_certainty ). This way, we have reduced the number of typological variants by 47,7 % from 44 to 23, making any comparisons and calculations straightforward while keeping the level of uncertainty connected with the typological classification of inscription separate and ready to be quantified. 195 Regular Expressions as historian's best friend When dealing with unstructured text, we heavily rely on the use of Regular Expressions as the most efficient yet simple tool for pattern matching (e.g. https://regex101.com/ ; packages stringr for R and gsub function in base R ). We search for repetitive patterns in the text of the attributes in order to separate different pieces of information so they can be easily computationally accessed in the later stages of the analysis. To illustrate our approach, we extract information providing a level of spatial uncertainty related to the findspot of an inscription from the textual descriptions of the place. The attribute findspot_ancient in EDH contained textual description of the original findspot, often accompanied with a marker of uncertainty (spatial fuzziness), e.g. “Cumae, bei”, "Roma?", "Emerita Augusta, aus", "Bracara Augusta - Lucus Augusti, inter", "Epidotium - Ancus, zwischen" . By eliminating the marker of uncertainty from the findspot_ancient , we have reduced the diversity of attribute by 35 %: 3613 unique values in the original findspot_ancient produced 2342 unique values after cleaning. In order to preserve the information about the level of uncertainty connected with the findspot location, we extracted the uncertainty markers into a new attribute finsdpot_ancient_certainty . Next, we tested the relative precision of the geographic coordinates, i.e. the number of decimal numbers the coordinates contain, against the new finsdpot_ancient_certainty attribute. We expected the number of decimal digits in coordinates to be inversely related to the amount of uncertainty extracted from the textual notation of findspot. High levels of uncertainty should be mirrored in the low number of decimals in coordinates and vice versa. After aggregating uncertainty categories into binary certain-uncertain values, an inverse pattern did become apparent. The uncertainty markers were present in 50 % of one-digit (low precision) coordinates but only in 30 % of four-digit (higher-precision) coordinates. The list of uncertainty values needs to be ordered for more detailed analysis. 196 Cleaning of epigraphic text R script for EDH dataset R script for EDCS dataset After we transformed the attributes containing data of the inscribed object, its origin, date and interpretation, we needed to streamline the text of an inscription in order to be suitable for computer-assisted analysis using text-mining techniques ( Tahmasebi, Hengchen 2019 ). The text of inscriptions from EDH and EDCS in its raw form contains extra text and editorial marks and symbols not present on the original medium, preventing the distant reading methods from producing any meaningful output. The symbols and various types of brackets are marked up in accordance with Leiden epigraphic conventions of critical text-editions communicating the rate of preservation of the text, the level of modern restoration or additional features of the text, such as interpunction or decoration ( Dow 1969 ; McLean 2003 , 27-39; Bruun, Edmondson 2015 , 12; Elliott, Bodard, Mylonas, Stoyanova, Tupman, Vanderbilt 2020 ). However useful is the Leiden markup system for the study and historical significance of individual inscriptions, it is highly problematic for any quantified study. Because the human brain is capable of parsing information differently than a computer, understanding the text with Leiden markup may seem straightforward to an epigrapher, but it proves to be a complex task for a computer. For example, the epigrapher understands that the text [Au]relios with the brackets is the same as Aurelios with no markup. However, for computers [Au]relios and Aurelios are two different sets of characters and thus are considered as two separate instances in computations. Our proposed technical solution eliminates the Leiden markup syntax in a systematic way and produces three different versions of the text designed specifically for their intended type of analysis in EDH, and one version of the text in EDCS. We have created a series of RegEx cleaning blocks that solve one type of markup at a time, and then we have built them in a cleaning function producing the desired outcome for the analysis of the text. The Leiden markup in EDCS slightly deviated from the standard application, providing its own specific syntax, e.g. [3] for blank space within a line or [6] for a blank line. Thus the cleaning script had to be slightly modified to fit the specifics of EDCS. The sequence of the blocks in the cleaning functions was built specifically for individual datasets and type of intended analysis, but the cleaning blocks were designed rather generically and can be used to clean any text marked according to the Leiden markup conventions, where EpiDoc XML/TEI files are not available, and thus the application of XSLT based transformation is not an option, such as the case of EDCS ( Elliott, Au, Bodard, Cayless, Lanz, Lawrence, Vanderbilt, Viglianti 2017 ). Example of a text of an inscription (EDH HD000003) before cleaning, including Leiden markup syntax: '[P(ublio) M]ummio [P(ubli) f(ilio)] / [Gal(eria) S]isenna[e Ru]/[tiliano] Xv[ir(o) stli]/[tibus iudicandis ---] / [------' The text of an inscription was transformed into two main versions:
A conservative version of the text, contained in the attribute clean_text_conservative . The aim of the conservative text was to have a text with no markup that is as close to the original inscription as preserved on the durable medium, similar in output as the diplomatic/ majuscule edition, currently available for in EDH. 'ummio isenna Xv' An interpretive version of the text, contained in the attribute clean_text_interpretive . The interpretive version contains the original text as preserved on a medium enriched with editorial interpretations, expanded abbreviations, and reconstructions of the text in order to achieve as rich text of an inscription as possible. For the purpose of text analysis, we have created two versions of the interpretive text:
one with no interpunction between sentences (clean_text_interpretive_word), applied both to EDH and EDCS dataset,
one with preserved interpunction separating individual sentences (clean_text_interpretive_sentence), applied only to EDH dataset. 'Publio Mummio Publi filio Galeria Sisennae Rutiliano X viro stlitibus iudicandis' The cleaning process was designed with the intention of the distant text reading and quantitative analysis of textual contents of inscriptions, and therefore it might not be useful or relevant for studies based on a close-reading of texts. The Leiden markup and additional text or symbols contained approximately one third of the length of text of inscriptions in both datasets, that we were able to eliminate. The cumulative length of texts of all inscriptions in EDH before cleaning was between 1.81 to 1.89 million words, depending on the counting method (base R vs stringr package in R). After the cleaning, the text of all inscriptions contained between 1.14 and 1.22 million words. In the case of the EDCS dataset, the text attribute before the cleaning contained between 7.1 and 6.6 million words, depending on the applied counting method (base R vs stringr package in R). After the cleaning, the text attribute contained between 4.6 and 4.06 million words. 197 Residual cleaning of EDCS inconsistent HTML markup The cleaning procedure of the EDCS dataset was more entailed as the attribute inscription , produced by the digital tool accessing the EDCS database, contained apart from the text of an inscription also commentary, notes to chronology, bibliographical references and other text, not present on the original inscribed medium. The mixup of the data was caused by the structure of the original EDCS website that was using the same HTML tags for the text of an inscription, its commentary and in some cases, alternate dates. However, the tags were not used consistently for all inscriptions, but appeared only in some records, so tool-wide modifications would not have been helpful. Thus, before we could clean the epigraphic text, we needed to separate the text of an inscription and the non-epigraphic text in a transparent and reproducible way. We developed an additional cleaning function in the EDCS text cleaning script , using Regular Expressions in a specific sequence to extract the redundant information, separate it by category and add it to the original dataset. During the separation process, we have managed to process 1268 inscriptions, representing 0.25 % of the entire dataset in a fraction of time that it would have taken a human to go through all the records and search for potential issues one-by-one. As a direct benefit of the scripted cleaning process to the epigraphic community, we are now able to report back to the creators of the tool accessing the EDCS the ID numbers of problematic records so the tool can be fixed for future researchers. The newest version of the lat-epig , v.2.0 released in late 2021 fixes the inconsistencies in the HTML markup of EDCS, providing access to data that do not require any additional cleaning of HTML markup residua ( Ballsun-Stanton, Heřmánková, Laurence 2021 ).
